[2014-09-11 20:16:48] adziki: hey all, I'm interested in using selendroid and had a few questions
[2014-09-11 20:20:08] adziki: my main questions revolve around my app being run through TravisCI, and the process for using Travis with Selendroid

[2014-09-11 20:29:32] adziki, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-09-11 20:32:52] lukeis: adziki: selendroid uses travis-ci itself to run the test suite
[2014-09-11 20:33:08] lukeis: (it's not very stable thoughâ€¦ fails inexplicably some times)
[2014-09-11 20:35:42] adziki: haha
[2014-09-11 20:35:43] adziki: ok
[2014-09-11 20:36:46] adziki: so I'm relatively new to Travis, but how are emulators created/saved/used on travis with selendroid?  any sample .yml or gradle projects that go through this process?
[2014-09-11 20:37:40] lukeis: this is the selendroid's project:  https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/.travis.yml
[2014-09-11 20:38:14] lukeis: the "script" is the part where we create the emulator

[2014-09-11 20:51:37] ddary: so I currently donâ€™t know how long I will stay in SF
[2014-09-11 20:52:04] lukeis: yepâ€¦ 30, 31  http://www.w3.org/2014/11/TPAC/
[2014-09-11 20:52:08] ddary: but the evening of the 30.10 it would be great to drink some beers
