[2014-05-19 17:26:30] lukeis: detronizator: was trying to see your opinion on doing the 0.10 releaseâ€¦ but I just did it anyway ;)
[2014-05-19 17:27:01] detronizator: well done
[2014-05-19 17:27:14] detronizator: unfortunately I'm not a Dominik replacement
[2014-05-19 17:27:27] lukeis: well, you've at least made some contributions ;)
[2014-05-19 17:27:44] detronizator: "unfortunately" as in "eBay didn't decide if they want me to work it or not and I'm not picking up another open source project using my free time (non exixtent)"
[2014-05-19 17:28:01] lukeis: heh ;)
[2014-05-19 17:28:05] lukeis: understandable :-D
[2014-05-19 17:28:15] lukeis: free time with family? what's that?
[2014-05-19 17:28:39] lukeis: (well, especially the little ones)
