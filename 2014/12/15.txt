[2014-12-15 20:59:22] lukeis: hi ddary
[2014-12-15 20:59:30] ddary: how are you doing?
[2014-12-15 20:59:43] lukeis: very well
[2014-12-15 21:00:04] lukeis: how about you?
[2014-12-15 21:01:14] ddary: good good
[2014-12-15 21:01:29] ddary: I just have seen this one:
[2014-12-15 21:01:30] ddary: https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/4195
[2014-12-15 21:01:59] ddary: do you know how is the plan of multitouch support in selenium?
[2014-12-15 21:06:14] lukeis: as apart of the w3c spec, and thus in like 3.0 or 4.0
[2014-12-15 21:07:08] ddary: ah ok
[2014-12-15 21:07:28] ddary: and what is the best way to support it upfront in other language bindings?
[2014-12-15 21:07:43] ddary: work and support the appium bindings?
[2014-12-15 21:07:53] ddary: ;-)
[2014-12-15 21:12:24] lukeis: work and support the spec :)
[2014-12-15 21:12:31] lukeis: and add spec tests
[2014-12-15 21:12:44] lukeis: and have selendroid pass those spec tests :)
[2014-12-15 21:12:51] ddary: :-)
[2014-12-15 21:12:59] ddary: when is the next spec meeting?
[2014-12-15 21:15:00] lukeis: there isn't one scheduled and we decided the mailing list would be used to try to get us to 1.0 of the spec
[2014-12-15 21:15:19] lukeis: fyi https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/webdriver
[2014-12-15 21:17:27] ddary: i subscribed to the w3c group but i never get mails there
[2014-12-15 21:17:35] ddary: do you get mails there?
[2014-12-15 21:17:42] lukeis: there haven't been any in a while
[2014-12-15 21:20:32] ddary: ah, that is maybe the reason
[2014-12-15 21:21:27] ddary: lukeis: have to look after the boy, see you soon
