[2014-04-08 11:41:43] TomC: hi
[2014-04-08 11:42:03] TomC: quick Q on HTTP authentication in the AndroidDriver Webview app
[2014-04-08 11:42:30] TomC: using selendroid for mobile web testing ONLY
[2014-04-08 11:42:30] TomC: not testing any app
[2014-04-08 11:43:24] TomC: PY code as follows:
[2014-04-08 11:43:30] TomC: self.driver.get("http://username:password@url.tld")
[2014-04-08 11:43:56] TomC: this will work OK on Android 4.4.x devices
[2014-04-08 11:44:07] TomC: but not on 4.1.x
[2014-04-08 11:44:52] TomC: the AndroidDriver Webview app will produce a 401 Auth Required
[2014-04-08 11:45:06] TomC: whereas 4.4 will work perfectly well
[2014-04-08 11:45:13] TomC: any ideas?
[2014-04-08 11:45:43] TomC: the 4.1 devices will work perfectly well with a URL which does not require authentication
[2014-04-08 11:45:52] TomC: eg http://www.rte.ie
[2014-04-08 11:52:09] TomC: also, when you put http://username:password@url.tld/ directly into the address bar of chrome or default browser on a 4.1.x device, it works OK
[2014-04-08 11:52:36] TomC: it just does not work in the AndroidDriver Webview App
[2014-04-08 11:52:41] TomC: i hope all of the above is clear
