[2014-04-07 11:07:24] TomC: good morning from Belfast, N.Ireland
[2014-04-07 11:07:34] TomC: quick Q about scaling?
[2014-04-07 11:08:00] linagee, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-04-07 11:08:47] TomC: will selendroid/selendroid scaling work only with Android 4.4.x?
[2014-04-07 11:08:58] TomC: seems to work OK on 4.4.x
[2014-04-07 11:09:24] TomC: but not on 4.1.x
[2014-04-07 11:11:34] TomC: is there a minimum version requirement?
[2014-04-07 11:24:28] TomC: anyone there?

[2014-04-07 11:40:21] ddary: Hi TomC
[2014-04-07 11:40:39] ddary: what do you mean by it scales only at android 4.4?
[2014-04-07 11:43:13] ddary: in general you can scale by using selenium grid: http://selendroid.io/scale.html
[2014-04-07 11:43:51] TomC: yes
[2014-04-07 11:44:14] TomC: the problem is this
[2014-04-07 11:44:34] TomC: it seems that the AndroidDriver Webvie app
[2014-04-07 11:44:51] TomC: will not run/install on Android 4.1.x
[2014-04-07 11:44:53] TomC: get me?
[2014-04-07 11:45:05] TomC: it WILL install/run on 4.4.x
[2014-04-07 11:45:41] ddary: how does your capabilities looks like
[2014-04-07 11:46:10] TomC: i have scaling working on multiple android devices which are 4.4.x
[2014-04-07 11:46:20] TomC: i am strictlyMOBILE WEB testing only
[2014-04-07 11:46:25] TomC: NOT app testing
[2014-04-07 11:46:30] TomC: here's the config JSON

[2014-04-07 11:47:01] TomC: }
[2014-04-07 11:47:37] ddary: that is the registration rquest
[2014-04-07 11:47:43] ddary: to the grid hub
[2014-04-07 11:48:00] TomC: should the AndroidSriver Webview App install and run on Android4.1.x?
[2014-04-07 11:48:16] ddary: i mean more like when you want to start the test, how do you specify the platformVersion?
[2014-04-07 11:48:21] ddary: yes
[2014-04-07 11:48:32] TomC: OK
[2014-04-07 11:49:33] TomC: i do not specify a platform version
[2014-04-07 11:49:45] ddary: that is the issue
[2014-04-07 11:50:01] ddary: if you have connected multiple devices with different paltform versions
[2014-04-07 11:50:22] ddary: if you go to the webpage http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/status
[2014-04-07 11:50:32] ddary: you will see what devices are available
[2014-04-07 11:50:41] ddary: when you start then your test
[2014-04-07 11:51:25] ddary: and if you then specifiy the platformVersion e.g. 10 selendroid-standalone tries to find a device with that platform version
[2014-04-07 11:51:54] ddary: http://selendroid.io/setup.html#androidDevices
[2014-04-07 11:52:40] TomC: hmm
[2014-04-07 11:52:48] TomC: OK
[2014-04-07 11:52:59] TomC: let me try specifying a platform version
[2014-04-07 11:53:21] TomC: i'll let you know...
[2014-04-07 11:53:41] ddary: ok
[2014-04-07 12:24:26] TomC: @ddary the problem is that the devices aren't being recognised
[2014-04-07 12:24:40] TomC: some devices will be recognised, others won't
[2014-04-07 12:25:05] TomC: it's probably a coincidence that 4.4.x devices will be recognised
[2014-04-07 12:25:10] TomC: and 4.1.x won't
[2014-04-07 12:25:39] TomC: when i run the server, it will detect when (for example) a nexus 7 is plugged in or out
[2014-04-07 12:26:10] TomC: nothing happens when i plug in/out a Samsung S2 Android 4.1.x
[2014-04-07 12:26:18] TomC: the server does not detect it
[2014-04-07 12:26:49] TomC: when i plug in a 4.1.x, the Android File Transfer app on my mac opens instead
[2014-04-07 12:27:15] TomC: but it does not register on the selendroid server
[2014-04-07 12:27:47] TomC: i probably need to alter some settings on the 4.1.x devices
[2014-04-07 12:29:07] TomC: back shortly

[2014-04-07 12:57:25] ddary: adb devices
[2014-04-07 12:57:34] ddary: selendroid must find it
[2014-04-07 13:01:13] TomC: @ddary need to update the SDK manager with some missing packages
[2014-04-07 13:01:23] TomC: that's probably the issue
