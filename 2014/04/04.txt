[2014-04-04 09:36:50] lukeis: hiya ddary
[2014-04-04 09:36:58] ddary: hi lukeis
[2014-04-04 09:37:16] ddary: there is some that looks exactly at the spec ;)
[2014-04-04 09:37:28] lukeis: this current bout of issues against the JSON wire protocol may get on my nerves ;)
[2014-04-04 09:37:38] lukeis: but that's *not* "the spec" :)
[2014-04-04 09:38:01] ddary: the issue is that people get confused by all the specs
[2014-04-04 09:38:10] ddary: me sometimes as well
[2014-04-04 09:38:17] ddary: to  be honest
[2014-04-04 09:38:17] lukeis: yep
[2014-04-04 09:39:00] ddary: but maybe we should define what the spec is that we plan to support
[2014-04-04 09:39:39] lukeis: that's a bit hardâ€¦ we support JSON wire, but really only however the main 4 languages implement it
[2014-04-04 09:40:00] lukeis: and i'll be making us compatible with the WebDriver W3C spec
