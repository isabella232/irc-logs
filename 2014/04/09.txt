[2014-04-09 17:24:08] smccarthy: I am confused how the SelendroidDriver knows the host and port of the selendroid server. In version 0.8.0, I passed in a url of the selendroid server, but in 0.9.0, the SelendroidDriver only takes a DesiredCapabilities object.
[2014-04-09 17:27:55] smccarthy: nm, I see it just changed from a string to a URL

[2014-04-09 17:55:40] detronizator: lukeis: I just fixed the test I broke
[2014-04-09 17:55:46] detronizator: Dominik just left here
[2014-04-09 17:55:49] lukeis: :)
[2014-04-09 17:55:52] detronizator: he is heading back to Amburg
[2014-04-09 17:55:58] detronizator: (not sure I spell Amburg right)
[2014-04-09 17:56:14] lukeis: Hamburg
[2014-04-09 17:56:24] detronizator: there you go :)
[2014-04-09 17:56:27] lukeis: ;)
[2014-04-09 17:57:06] lukeis: manâ€¦ a german and an italian communicating in englishâ€¦ did you guys actually communicate? :-D
[2014-04-09 18:07:17] detronizator: Dominik was amazing
[2014-04-09 18:07:21] detronizator: his english is great
[2014-04-09 18:07:33] detronizator: it was one of the best Pair-Programming I have ever done
[2014-04-09 18:07:42] lukeis: awesome :)
[2014-04-09 18:07:45] detronizator: with some people is really difficult to "think in sync"
[2014-04-09 18:07:49] detronizator: with him was immediate
[2014-04-09 18:08:10] detronizator: and that's why we manage to do stuff very soon: I had not touch the code base before Monday
[2014-04-09 18:08:59] lukeis: nice! and welcome to the project :)
[2014-04-09 18:12:21] detronizator: thanks

[2014-04-09 18:25:51] detronizator: asking me for DETAILED instructions
[2014-04-09 18:25:54] detronizator: on how to setup selendroid
[2014-04-09 18:25:58] detronizator: mind you, DETAILED
[2014-04-09 18:26:31] detronizator: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/r6ROxhUf
[2014-04-09 18:31:20] detronizator: Build is green again :)
[2014-04-09 18:31:24] detronizator: I can go home happy
[2014-04-09 18:36:30] lukeis: i got the same email
[2014-04-09 18:50:10] detronizator: very frequent stuff?
[2014-04-09 18:50:12] detronizator: or a rarity?
[2014-04-09 18:50:25] detronizator: I usually ignore this kind of stuff for GhostDriver
[2014-04-09 18:50:31] lukeis: i ignore it too
[2014-04-09 18:50:38] lukeis: there's a selendroid mailing list...
[2014-04-09 18:50:47] lukeis: which goes right to my inbox too ;)
[2014-04-09 18:51:03] lukeis: it's relatively rare though on selendroid
[2014-04-09 18:51:22] lukeis: i'm sure dominik gets a lot more ;)
[2014-04-09 18:51:54] lukeis: github issues being used like a mailing list forum to ask questions is my pet-peeve though

[2014-04-09 23:44:22] modeck: it's with a snippet of jQuery
[2014-04-09 23:44:57] modeck:  a script is added to page head
