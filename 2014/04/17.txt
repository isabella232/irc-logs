[2014-04-17 13:55:50] Acemond: Hey
[2014-04-17 13:56:22] Acemond: I'm getting : Failure [INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES] while using Selendroid on a lot of different apks
[2014-04-17 13:56:30] Acemond: Is that a known problem ?
[2014-04-17 13:57:15] Acemond: (I launch Selendroid with : java -Xmx2048M -Xms2048M -jar ./selendroid-standalone-0.10.0-SNAPSHOT-with-dependencies.jar -forceReinstall -app ./ru.blogspot.playsib.savageknife.apk)
[2014-04-17 14:54:42] Acemond: Ok found the solution if anyone struggles on the same issue.
[2014-04-17 16:23:52] sirsteve: sign the apk?

[2014-04-17 17:05:46] Acemond: nope it was signed
[2014-04-17 17:06:05] Acemond: Selendroid wasn't correcly removing all of the META-INF folder before signing though
[2014-04-17 17:06:16] Acemond: so the apk wouldn't install correctly
[2014-04-17 17:06:38] Acemond: gotta go, sya
