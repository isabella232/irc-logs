[2014-06-10 20:50:23] nm_: Hi, I completed automating some tests and was able to run tests on emulator. Now I want to run the tests on grid. So I did follow the steps listed in http://selendroid.io/scale.html . But on the grid console, http://localhost:4444/grid/console, I noticed message "SelendroidSessionProxy: Unknown version. The target server failed to respond" .
[2014-06-10 20:50:47] nm_: Any suggestions will be great
[2014-06-10 20:54:49] nm_: Also on the http://localhost:4444/grid/console it does show the selendroid and android images that I mentioned in the capabilities section in selendroid-node-config.json
[2014-06-10 20:55:17] nm_: But I am not clear why it shows "SelendroidSessionProxy: Unknown version. The target server failed to respond"  message on the grid console
[2014-06-10 20:56:13] nm_: Any idea what might have gone wrong

[2014-06-10 22:49:20] lukeis: nm_: do you have any network issues? like the node has the port blocked that you're trying to have the grid hub connect to?
[2014-06-10 22:51:18] nm_: There are no network issues. I started the hub on 4444 and registered node.
[2014-06-10 22:51:31] nm_: I can give the commands that I did
[2014-06-10 22:51:55] nm_: 1- java -jar selendroid-standalone-0.10.0-with-dependencies.jar -app eBaymobile_internal_2.5.0.25.apk -port 5555
[2014-06-10 22:52:10] lukeis: the node, can you hit it  http://<node host>:5555/wd/hub ?
[2014-06-10 22:52:33] nm_: 2-  java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp "selendroid-grid-plugin-0.10.0.jar:selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0.jar" org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher -capabilityMatcher io.selendroid.grid.SelendroidCapabilityMatcher -role hub -host localhost -port 4444
[2014-06-10 22:52:47] lukeis: wd/hub/status  i meant :)
[2014-06-10 22:53:37] nm_: I do see the android emulators
[2014-06-10 22:53:47] nm_: something like this
[2014-06-10 22:53:48] nm_: {"status":0,"value":{"supportedApps":[{"appId":"com.ebay.mobile:2.5.0.25","mainActivity":"com.ebay.mobile.activities.eBay","basePackage":"com.ebay.mobile"},{"appId":"io.selendroid.androiddriver:0.10.0","mainActivity":"io.selendroid.androiddriver.WebViewActivity","basePackage":"io.selendroid.androiddriver"}],"os":{"arch":"x86_64","name":"Mac OS X","version":"10.8.5"},"build":{"browserName":"selendroid","version":"0.10.0"},"supported
[2014-06-10 22:53:57] lukeis: ok
[2014-06-10 22:54:22] smccarthy2, quitting. (*.net *.split)
[2014-06-10 22:54:42] nm_: Then I started hub as 2-java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp "selendroid-grid-plugin-0.10.0.jar:selenium-server-standalone-2.41.0.jar" org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher -capabilityMatcher io.selendroid.grid.SelendroidCapabilityMatcher -role hub -host localhost -port 4444
[2014-06-10 22:54:56] nm_: 3- then registered node as curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data @selendroid-nodes-config.json http://localhost:4444/grid/register
[2014-06-10 22:56:20] nm_: 4- selendroid-nodes-config.json content is
[2014-06-10 22:57:24] nm_: {   "capabilities": [{       "browserName": "selendroid",       "maxInstances": 1,       "aut": "com.ebay.mobile:2.5.0.25",       "locale": "en_US",       "emulator": True,       "androidTarget": "ANDROID15"   }, {       "browserName": "android",       "maxInstances": 1   }],   "configuration": {       "maxSession": 1,       "register": true,       "hubHost": "localhost",       "hubPort": 4444,       "remoteHost": "http://localhost
[2014-06-10 22:57:52] nm_: id.grid.SelendroidSessionProxy"   } }
[2014-06-10 23:01:03] lukeis: sorry, i don't immediately see where the issue is… and I don't run selendroid as a grid locally :(
[2014-06-10 23:02:49] nm_: Can you shed some light on how you configured selendroid with the grid. Do you have a machine on which you start the hub and have the VM images registered as nodes
[2014-06-10 23:02:51] nm_: ?
[2014-06-10 23:03:26] lukeis: i don't use selenium grid
[2014-06-10 23:04:02] lukeis: françois knows a lot about selenium grid at ebay ;)
[2014-06-10 23:04:31] nm_: But he works on ios-driver
[2014-06-10 23:04:38] nm_: and ofcourse familiar with grid
[2014-06-10 23:04:43] lukeis: very similar stuff here
[2014-06-10 23:05:17] lukeis: the grid component has nothing to do with ios-driver nor selendroid directly
[2014-06-10 23:05:52] nm_: But there is slendroid plugin that we are hooking when we start the selenuium grid hub
[2014-06-10 23:06:19] lukeis: ok… and i don't know anything about it, i don't use it
[2014-06-10 23:07:11] nm_: Ok, so you do run selendroid tests but not on grid. Is it?
[2014-06-10 23:07:20] lukeis: correct
[2014-06-10 23:07:53] nm_: Ok, thank you. I will check with francois and also will post in selendroid forum
[2014-06-10 23:08:04] nm_: Will see if I can get any help
[2014-06-10 23:08:32] lukeis: have you tried to debug further? looked at the source code even? :)
[2014-06-10 23:08:33] nm_: Thank you
[2014-06-10 23:10:54] nm_: No I didn't. But I don't see any error when I start the hub or register the node. I notice the error when I open the link http://localhost:4444/grid/console
[2014-06-10 23:11:11] smccarthy2, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-06-10 23:11:14] nm_: I mean I don't see error on console
[2014-06-10 23:11:49] nm_: Actually one more thing
[2014-06-10 23:12:28] nm_: I am just noticing this error on console where I started hub when I sent the curl command to register node
[2014-06-10 23:12:37] nm_: Jun 10, 2014 11:33:14 AM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute INFO: I/O exception (org.apache.http.NoHttpResponseException) caught when processing request: The target server failed to respond Jun 10, 2014 11:33:14 AM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute INFO: Retrying request Jun 10, 2014 11:33:14 AM org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRequestDirector tryExecute INFO: I/O exception (
[2014-06-10 23:14:11] lukeis: are you sure the hub can talk to the node? … everything seems like it can't
[2014-06-10 23:15:07] nm_: Right now, no hub can't talk to node. This error happened multiple times today.
[2014-06-10 23:17:49] nm_: At times, I noticed this error doesn't show up and I can see the grid console and the nodes registered when I open http://localhost:4444/grid/console. But along with that I see a message on grid/console as "SelendroidSessionProxy: Unknown version. The target server failed to respond"
[2014-06-10 23:19:55] nm_: So there are two issues, 1- when I sent a curl command to register node, I notice the error message(above). So the hub and node can't communicate 2- if #1 doens't happen and the node is registered but then I see a message on grid/console as  a message on grid/console as "SelendroidSessionProxy: Unknown version. The target server failed to respond"
