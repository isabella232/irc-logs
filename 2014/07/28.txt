[2014-07-28 09:46:19] operatiay: :note ddary the scenario is a large native structure rather than a website. a test for this would be to dynamically create some hundreds of items and load it to the inspector (or the corresponding http call). Unfortunately I am not familiar with writing android code to do it easily (would have to google for it) and the time schedule doesn't allow it now... should noone do it till I get some time to do it, I'll try it out and add a test

Do you may have an element with a special character in the tree?
[2014-07-28 21:10:30] ddary: lukeis: have you seen any issues with large object trees like ^^?
