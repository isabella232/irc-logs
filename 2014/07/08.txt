[2014-07-08 12:46:19] ddary, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-07-08 12:47:35] ddary: hi operatiay, only with the remote web driver or as well with the selendroidClient?
[2014-07-08 12:48:24] operatiay: not using selendroidClient... might try it though
[2014-07-08 12:50:06] operatiay: hm... how is it supposed to be used?
[2014-07-08 12:50:40] operatiay: I mean I am using SelendroidDriver which is part of selendroid-client jar
[2014-07-08 12:50:49] ddary: when I run the selendroid tests, it uses the selendroid client and there i didn't had seen it
[2014-07-08 12:51:00] ddary: ah , ok
[2014-07-08 12:51:04] operatiay: this results in RemoteWebDriver calls in the stack
[2014-07-08 12:51:12] ddary: what kind of issues are you having?
[2014-07-08 12:52:06] operatiay: the issue is that I am not able to find elements on page. I am trying to wait for an element by Id. The result is in the comment I've made to your pull request
