[2014-07-08 11:28:15] operatiay: thanks :) I'll do that

[2014-07-08 12:31:13] juuh: Has anyone dealed with this problem: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/issues/469 ?
[2014-07-08 12:46:19] ddary, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-07-08 12:47:35] ddary: hi operatiay, only with the remote web driver or as well with the selendroidClient?
[2014-07-08 12:48:24] operatiay: not using selendroidClient... might try it though
[2014-07-08 12:50:06] operatiay: hm... how is it supposed to be used?
[2014-07-08 12:50:40] operatiay: I mean I am using SelendroidDriver which is part of selendroid-client jar
[2014-07-08 12:50:49] ddary: when I run the selendroid tests, it uses the selendroid client and there i didn't had seen it
[2014-07-08 12:51:00] ddary: ah , ok
[2014-07-08 12:51:04] operatiay: this results in RemoteWebDriver calls in the stack
[2014-07-08 12:51:12] ddary: what kind of issues are you having?
[2014-07-08 12:52:06] operatiay: the issue is that I am not able to find elements on page. I am trying to wait for an element by Id. The result is in the comment I've made to your pull request
[2014-07-08 12:53:39] operatiay: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Returned value cannot be converted to WebElement: Resource not found.{"sessionId":"f56f28ff-ed9c-fd63-42a8-9e25b68198f7","value":{"ELEMENT":"1dfaec1a-5b2c-c91c-ac82-0dd88a0
[2014-07-08 12:55:03] operatiay: it's on the line where it's being cast from String to WebDriver

[2014-07-08 13:00:29] ddary: ok, thanks, i will have a look this evening
[2014-07-08 13:08:52] juuh: ddary: could you help me with my problem ? :) here's the github issue i made: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/issues/469
[2014-07-08 14:20:47] lukeis: juuh: your issue doesn't really fully describe the problem, at least it's hard to understand (and very likely not reproducible by us)
[2014-07-08 14:21:02] juuh: hmm okay sry
[2014-07-08 14:21:19] lukeis: is there a way for us to reproduce?
[2014-07-08 14:21:19] juuh: so the problem is that i'm trying to selendroid with app that uses android+cordova
[2014-07-08 14:21:30] lukeis: my app uses that
[2014-07-08 14:21:31] juuh: i'm not sure since i cant share that app
[2014-07-08 14:21:35] juuh: okay
[2014-07-08 14:21:41] juuh: umm so at the start i get that error
[2014-07-08 14:21:58] lukeis: "at the start"? when you create a new instance?
[2014-07-08 14:22:05] juuh: when i'm starting to debug
[2014-07-08 14:22:13] juuh: its like the first thing that appears on logcat
[2014-07-08 14:22:31] lukeis: is that coming from the app or from selendroid's output?
[2014-07-08 14:22:39] lukeis: seems like the app itself
[2014-07-08 14:22:41] juuh: from app
[2014-07-08 14:22:46] juuh: but the app works normally
[2014-07-08 14:22:59] juuh: and for some reason it gives me that error when i'm using it with selendroid
[2014-07-08 14:23:08] juuh: so i was thinking that it has something to do with selendroid
[2014-07-08 14:23:20] lukeis: possible, but still uncertain
[2014-07-08 14:23:29] juuh: true
[2014-07-08 14:23:43] juuh: so u had an app which was using android + cordova ?
[2014-07-08 14:23:50] lukeis: yes, Salesforce1
[2014-07-08 14:23:53] juuh: okay
[2014-07-08 14:24:17] lukeis: is your app in the play store?
[2014-07-08 14:24:20] juuh: i just dont get it, why does it throw that pop-up after i/selendroid selects some field
[2014-07-08 14:24:21] juuh: no sry
[2014-07-08 14:24:30] juuh: its not "mine" just something i'm working on :P
[2014-07-08 14:24:36] lukeis: ok :)
[2014-07-08 14:24:37] juuh: or trying to make automated test to it
[2014-07-08 14:24:44] juuh: aka work stuff
[2014-07-08 14:25:09] juuh: the weird thing is that the app works normally fine, without any problems/errors
[2014-07-08 14:25:14] lukeis: no worriesâ€¦ i'd be happy to sign an nda or something and you share the app privately if you want me to try and look at it more
[2014-07-08 14:25:47] juuh: hehe thx :)
[2014-07-08 14:27:01] juuh: but is there someway to click cancel on such pop-ups ?
[2014-07-08 14:27:22] lukeis: yes
[2014-07-08 14:27:29] juuh: just like any other click ?
[2014-07-08 14:27:32] lukeis: yep
[2014-07-08 14:27:55] juuh: hmm weird, i took the value from inspector and it doesn't recognize it or something
[2014-07-08 14:27:58] lukeis: driver.findElement(By.id("button1")).click()  (i believe that's the id for the standard 'alert' window)
[2014-07-08 14:28:05] juuh: ye i think its like that
[2014-07-08 14:29:11] juuh: well i'll give it a shot one (few) more time(s)
[2014-07-08 14:29:16] juuh: thx mate :)
