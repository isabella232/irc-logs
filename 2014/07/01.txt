[2014-07-01 19:51:39] ddary: hi lukeis
[2014-07-01 19:51:44] lukeis: hi ddary
[2014-07-01 19:52:04] ddary: we should not do a release until webbit is removed
[2014-07-01 19:52:05] lukeis: it's like you know when your are being talked to ;)
[2014-07-01 19:52:15] ddary: :-)
[2014-07-01 19:52:23] lukeis: who's working on the removal?
[2014-07-01 19:52:38] ddary: simon said that they will push a diff
[2014-07-01 19:52:59] ddary: if they are not doing it, i will work on that on this weekend/beginning of next week
[2014-07-01 19:53:01] lukeis: â€¦ soâ€¦ in a month? ;)
[2014-07-01 19:53:10] ddary: ;-)
[2014-07-01 19:53:25] lukeis: (the backgrounding thing we really want available...)
[2014-07-01 19:53:39] lukeis: and sauce labs won't push an update for us right now until we have a release :'(
[2014-07-01 19:53:42] ddary: the thing is, that with the fix for supporting the new httpclient we deliver sometimes only half responses
[2014-07-01 19:54:16] lukeis: i'm working on that last partâ€¦ but it's an uphill battle...
[2014-07-01 19:54:26] ddary: ok
[2014-07-01 19:54:32] ddary: i will have soon a call
[2014-07-01 19:54:43] ddary: then i will be back later on
[2014-07-01 19:54:45] lukeis: o
[2014-07-01 19:54:47] lukeis: k
[2014-07-01 19:54:47] lukeis: :)

[2014-07-01 21:36:17] ddary: you said you are working on a fix
[2014-07-01 21:36:27] lukeis: i am not working on anything :)
[2014-07-01 21:36:33] lukeis: (in selendroid at the moment)
[2014-07-01 21:36:38] ddary: what :-)
[2014-07-01 21:36:47] lukeis: "at the moment"
[2014-07-01 21:37:00] Ragnaroek: I'm having problems with selendroid in combination with geb
[2014-07-01 21:37:00] lukeis: my intern is working on some things...
[2014-07-01 21:37:07] ddary: cool
[2014-07-01 21:37:58] lukeis: but the issue i was describing is needing a new feature (in this case the newly minted background / resume app feature) and that I don't have a way to run that in Saucelabs without making a selendroid release (they are being a bit of a pain about this)
[2014-07-01 21:39:04] ddary: as i said, i have a bad feeling shipping it now because of the bug i described
[2014-07-01 21:39:16] Ragnaroek: geb refuses anything that isn't a input, select or textarea to be assigned. Does selendroid something weird with this html elements?
[2014-07-01 21:39:28] ddary: if we ship it with the current bug we will have a lot of issues we will have to handle
[2014-07-01 21:40:03] ddary: lukeis, please ask simon as well for the diff :-)
[2014-07-01 21:40:32] ddary: as i said, if nothing will be there untill the weekend, i will work on this comming weekend on it on myself
[2014-07-01 21:40:52] ddary: so would be good if you can wait until monday
[2014-07-01 21:42:48] lukeis: ok
[2014-07-01 21:43:19] lukeis: Ragnaroek: sorry, i don't know anything about gebâ€¦ and I don't have any issues like you're describing
[2014-07-01 21:43:48] ddary: lukeis: thanks
[2014-07-01 21:43:54] lukeis: :)
[2014-07-01 21:44:27] ddary: lukeis: wife and son are on vacatation and I have a free weekend :-) awesome, looking forward to it
[2014-07-01 21:44:35] lukeis: nice :)
[2014-07-01 21:44:41] lukeis: come to london next week too? ;)
[2014-07-01 21:45:37] ddary: no, sadly not,
[2014-07-01 21:45:48] ddary: have to work for my employer
[2014-07-01 21:46:17] lukeis: bah
[2014-07-01 21:46:31] ddary: but will be online as much as i can
[2014-07-01 21:47:41] lukeis: sounds good :)
[2014-07-01 21:48:10] lukeis: mobile isn't the fore-front of the conversation, since it's been tabled to spec 2.0â€¦ but I chime in when I can :)
[2014-07-01 21:49:50] ddary: sounds good, go Luke go :-)
[2014-07-01 22:18:16] AutomatedTester: mobile shmobile
[2014-07-01 22:18:33] AutomatedTester: its not the future so who cares
[2014-07-01 22:18:50] lukeis: :-P

[2014-07-01 22:19:46] AutomatedTester: watching the google IO keynote... how boring are there announcements this year
[2014-07-01 22:20:31] lukeis: fairlyâ€¦. wearablesâ€¦ but it's not a great experience (after using mine)
[2014-07-01 22:22:20] AutomatedTester: maybe I am too old but why would I want my watch to buzz when my phone does too?
[2014-07-01 22:22:32] AutomatedTester: also... who wears watches?
[2014-07-01 22:22:51] ddary: AutomatedTester: exactly the same question I asked myself
[2014-07-01 22:24:28] AutomatedTester: the Chromecast stuff I can see
[2014-07-01 22:24:38] AutomatedTester: people want to move things between their screens
[2014-07-01 22:26:35] ddary: I want to watch this videos about docker. Have heard good things from a colleague that attended the session
[2014-07-01 22:27:33] lukeis: faster response to see your watch (don't have to take it out of the pocket)â€¦ and people (some) do still wear watches...
[2014-07-01 22:27:54] ddary: AutomatedTester: just out of curiosity: do you have a pointer to a mozilla wiki how you test firefoxOS?
[2014-07-01 22:28:38] AutomatedTester: ddary: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Platform/Automated_testing
[2014-07-01 22:28:43] AutomatedTester: thats what Google says :)
[2014-07-01 22:28:58] ddary: awesome, thanks!
[2014-07-01 22:29:17] AutomatedTester: lukeis: how many glassholes were at i/o?
