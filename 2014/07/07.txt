[2014-07-07 08:54:37] ddary: @operatiay good morning, can you may have a look as weel at this PR https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/pull/465 ? The thing is, it is a larger refactoring and would be great if you can build this version and run your tests with it to see if everything is fine. Selendroid's test suites were looking good
