[2014-03-10 12:58:11] sascha_: Hi ddary, how to execute an adb command to enable/disable the network connection for example
[2014-03-10 12:58:13] sascha_: ?
[2014-03-10 12:58:38] ddary: we have not yet implemented that
[2014-03-10 12:58:58] ddary: do you have an example about you can disable/enable it via adb?
[2014-03-10 13:00:15] sascha_: I wanted to try this one here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10033757/how-to-turn-off-wifi-via-adb
[2014-03-10 13:01:09] ddary: what we can do is to let you execute this shell scripts
[2014-03-10 13:01:43] ddary: via https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-client/src/main/java/io/selendroid/adb/AdbConnection.java
[2014-03-10 13:04:52] sascha_: ok, I see that the SelendroidDriver implements the AdbSupport in the master branch but not on the 0.8.0 tag :(
[2014-03-10 13:11:53] ddary: exactly
[2014-03-10 13:12:07] ddary: that is a new feature for the next release
[2014-03-10 13:13:38] ddary: but the good thing is, i can add you the shell execution support
[2014-03-10 13:14:06] ddary: then you have everything when next version is there
[2014-03-10 13:43:01] sascha_: where is the snapshot repository located? I tried this url: http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/ but I get an 404
[2014-03-10 13:43:41] ddary: out github location is http://github.com/selendroid/selendroid
[2014-03-10 13:43:53] ddary: the latest snapshots you fine here
[2014-03-10 13:43:56] ddary: :snapshot
[2014-03-10 13:44:50] sascha_: I wanted to use 0.9.0-SNAPSHOT directly in maven
[2014-03-10 13:45:46] ddary: then you have ti build it locally

[2014-03-10 16:26:18] sascha_: ddary, your shell execution feature works, unfortunately if i run 'adb shell "svc data disable"' the selendroid test app is no longer reachable by the SelendroidDriver
[2014-03-10 16:27:13] ddary: :)
[2014-03-10 16:27:44] ddary: good that it works, but not the effect we expectect
