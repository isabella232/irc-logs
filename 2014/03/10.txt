[2014-03-10 12:58:11] sascha_: Hi ddary, how to execute an adb command to enable/disable the network connection for example
[2014-03-10 12:58:13] sascha_: ?
[2014-03-10 12:58:38] ddary: we have not yet implemented that
[2014-03-10 12:58:58] ddary: do you have an example about you can disable/enable it via adb?
[2014-03-10 13:00:15] sascha_: I wanted to try this one here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10033757/how-to-turn-off-wifi-via-adb
[2014-03-10 13:01:09] ddary: what we can do is to let you execute this shell scripts
[2014-03-10 13:01:43] ddary: via https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-client/src/main/java/io/selendroid/adb/AdbConnection.java
[2014-03-10 13:04:52] sascha_: ok, I see that the SelendroidDriver implements the AdbSupport in the master branch but not on the 0.8.0 tag :(
[2014-03-10 13:11:53] ddary: exactly
[2014-03-10 13:12:07] ddary: that is a new feature for the next release
[2014-03-10 13:13:38] ddary: but the good thing is, i can add you the shell execution support
[2014-03-10 13:14:06] ddary: then you have everything when next version is there
[2014-03-10 13:43:01] sascha_: where is the snapshot repository located? I tried this url: http://dominikdary.github.io/selendroid/ but I get an 404
[2014-03-10 13:43:41] ddary: out github location is http://github.com/selendroid/selendroid
[2014-03-10 13:43:53] ddary: the latest snapshots you fine here
[2014-03-10 13:43:56] ddary: :snapshot
[2014-03-10 13:44:50] sascha_: I wanted to use 0.9.0-SNAPSHOT directly in maven
[2014-03-10 13:45:46] ddary: then you have ti build it locally

[2014-03-10 16:26:18] sascha_: ddary, your shell execution feature works, unfortunately if i run 'adb shell "svc data disable"' the selendroid test app is no longer reachable by the SelendroidDriver
[2014-03-10 16:27:13] ddary: :)
[2014-03-10 16:27:44] ddary: good that it works, but not the effect we expectect
[2014-03-10 16:28:00] smccarthy, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-03-10 16:30:17] sascha_: but this feature is still usefull if you have to set the time of the emulator for example

[2014-03-10 17:07:09] lukeis: hiya ddary, this looks like it's going to be a very productive month for selendroid for you ;) it's like you'll be working on the project full time :-D
[2014-03-10 17:07:23] ddary: hi lukeis
[2014-03-10 17:07:36] ddary: hopefully it is productive
[2014-03-10 17:07:56] ddary: :)
[2014-03-10 17:08:19] lukeis: i just saw your discussion with sascha_ about offlineâ€¦ that's what this is supposed to be for:  https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/spec-draft.md?repo=mobile#104
[2014-03-10 17:08:40] lukeis: (and I have a story at work to work on it next week)
[2014-03-10 17:10:16] ddary: awesome
[2014-03-10 17:10:44] ddary: the good thing with execute shell script is, that now a lot of thing can be done by the users
[2014-03-10 17:11:11] ddary: the interesting thing about the flight mode is actually how to make sure we can connect to the selendroid server :D
[2014-03-10 17:11:22] ddary: any idea?
[2014-03-10 17:11:42] lukeis: not certain :)
[2014-03-10 17:12:53] lukeis: i assumed we might be just able to get away with it since we're using the USB connection for a real device
[2014-03-10 17:14:17] lukeis: also, i might try a different approach than adb commandsâ€¦ a co-worker of mine wrote this a long time ago (he's not sure it works anymore for later versions) but it may be an option: http://dustinbreese.blogspot.com/2009/04/andoid-controlling-airplane-mode.html
[2014-03-10 17:14:58] lukeis: would mean the app needs an extra setting, but I'm ok with that ;)
[2014-03-10 17:15:01] lukeis: brb
[2014-03-10 17:15:55] ddary: extra permissions, i don't know
[2014-03-10 17:16:30] ddary: maybe this is somehting for the "add extension" at runtome?
[2014-03-10 17:16:37] ddary: runtime
