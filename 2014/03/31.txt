[2014-03-31 17:43:19] martink_: Hi guys, I realized the assets for the Selendroid Inspector (css and js files) are actually served from the device. Is this necessary? I thought the inspector could be served by selendroid-standalone running locally? Thanks!
[2014-03-31 17:44:36] ddary: martink: the bennefit it that the inspector can also be used without the standalone
[2014-03-31 17:44:57] ddary: i know, not much people use it that way
[2014-03-31 17:45:28] ddary: but when i develop only in the selendroid server, i personally usually use only the server
