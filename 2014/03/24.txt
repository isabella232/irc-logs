[2014-03-24 17:50:37] gimpneek: Hi all, Looking for some help with gestures. Anyone have experience using these?
[2014-03-24 17:52:03] gimpneek: I've kind of fallen at the first hurdle. I've added the "HasTouchScreen" capability when setting up my remoteWebDriver but when I try to use flick on an element I get a cannot cast to HasTouchScreen exception
[2014-03-24 17:52:19] lukeis: the gesture implementation is still a bit lacking, basically all I do is flick's and touch down / move's
[2014-03-24 17:52:47] lukeis: you need to Augment your driver then
[2014-03-24 17:52:54] gimpneek: I've tried that too
[2014-03-24 17:53:28] lukeis: WebDriver augmentedDriver = new Augmenter().augment(driver);   ?
[2014-03-24 17:53:55] lukeis: or you can directly consume / use the SelendroidDriver provided by this project
[2014-03-24 17:53:59] gimpneek: if it helps im using Scala instead of Java for this so I have val augmentedDriver = new Augmenter().augment(Env.browser.webDriver)
[2014-03-24 17:54:11] lukeis: is that implemented in scala?
[2014-03-24 17:54:24] *lukeis has no idea about scala or it's implementation with Selenium'
[2014-03-24 17:54:43] gimpneek: it's using a Java library called Fluentlenium
[2014-03-24 17:56:43] gimpneek: nw about Scala knowledge, just looking for pointers / stories of hardship that might lead to solution :)
[2014-03-24 17:57:21] gimpneek: Is it better to declare capabilities on browser or to use augmented one?
[2014-03-24 17:57:45] gimpneek: sorry by browser i mean webdriver
[2014-03-24 17:58:02] lukeis: here's SelendroidDriver:  https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-client/src/main/java/io/selendroid/SelendroidDriver.java
[2014-03-24 17:58:22] lukeis: it's certainly easier to declare an implementation that includes the interfaces
[2014-03-24 18:02:28] gimpneek: Awesome I'll try that thanks

[2014-03-24 19:06:58] depp: Hi Guys, have a question need your help.
[2014-03-24 19:07:23] depp: I was referring to quick start document at http://selendroid.io/quickStart.html
[2014-03-24 19:07:41] depp: and noticed this command
[2014-03-24 19:07:41] depp: java -jar selendroid-standalone-0.9.0-with-dependencies.jar -aut EmployeeDirectory.apk -aut selendroid-test-app-0.9.0.apk"
[2014-03-24 19:08:16] depp: this command shows that selendroid can take 2 apk as input ( 2 or more, if i pass those, right)?
[2014-03-24 19:09:19] depp: i am working on automating a set of apk which are kinda of interlinked. that is have a central apk file which is first invoked and then it act as a key provider for other apk files which are launched.
[2014-03-24 19:11:08] depp: now the problem is if how we can create different selendroid server apk and put all of them at same time on our device?
[2014-03-24 19:11:08] depp: - mvn install -Dandroid.renameInstrumentationTargetPackage=io.selendroid.testapp
[2014-03-24 19:11:25] depp: any input/thoughts would be helpful.
