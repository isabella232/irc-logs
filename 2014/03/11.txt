[2014-03-11 15:17:55] sascha_: Hi, how do I restart the app without creating a new driver?
[2014-03-11 15:26:06] sascha_: ddary, *highlight* :)
[2014-03-11 15:26:33] ddary: hi sasha_
[2014-03-11 15:26:55] ddary: there is currently no way to do it
[2014-03-11 15:27:03] sascha_: ok
[2014-03-11 15:27:15] ddary: i guess you know that you can start activities via driver.get()
[2014-03-11 15:27:36] ddary: what you can do is, that you start the main activity manually
[2014-03-11 15:28:06] ddary: but that will just start the activity and is of course not an fresh start
[2014-03-11 15:35:58] sascha_: ok driver.get(driver.getCurrentUrl()); seems to work for a hybrid app
[2014-03-11 15:37:31] ddary: if you are in native mode, it is
[2014-03-11 15:38:11] ddary: driver.get("and-activity://io.selendroid.testapp.HomeScreenActivity")

[2014-03-11 16:31:05] selendroid-git, leaving. (#selendroid)
[2014-03-11 16:31:29] ddary: hi lukeis
[2014-03-11 16:31:35] lukeis: hi
[2014-03-11 16:31:43] lukeis: platformVersion makes much more sense :)
[2014-03-11 16:32:03] ddary: :)
[2014-03-11 16:32:31] ddary: so i tested the different variants and it seems like i dodn't break something
[2014-03-11 16:32:45] lukeis: doesn't look like you made it reverse compatible though
[2014-03-11 16:33:00] lukeis: can you pass in "ANDROIDTARGET" ?
[2014-03-11 16:33:27] ddary: yes, if still androidTarget is used
[2014-03-11 16:33:36] ddary: it is still supported
[2014-03-11 16:33:54] ddary: even if you enter ANDROID17 or just 17
[2014-03-11 16:34:02] ddary: all cases should work
[2014-03-11 16:35:09] ddary: do you know, what should be returned as a platform name, if we hit the status servlet?
[2014-03-11 16:35:28] lukeis: i think dalvik
[2014-03-11 16:35:34] ddary: i guess there should be the name of the platform we automate, right?
[2014-03-11 16:35:35] ddary: ok
[2014-03-11 16:35:59] ddary: because currently we return at the standalone x86
[2014-03-11 16:36:47] ddary: or just 'android'?
[2014-03-11 16:36:47] ddary: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/spec-draft.md?repo=mobile#53
[2014-03-11 16:40:34] lukeis: looks like either will workâ€¦ https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/selenium-2.25.0/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/Platform.java#L77
[2014-03-11 16:40:41] lukeis: we can stick with 'android' :)
[2014-03-11 16:41:13] ddary: ok
[2014-03-11 16:41:20] ddary: then i will add this as well
[2014-03-11 16:41:21] lukeis: heh, was looking at android code on an old tagâ€¦ master link: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/Platform.java#L88
[2014-03-11 16:41:57] ddary: the other thing i want to work on is the source format thing
[2014-03-11 16:42:32] lukeis: ok :)
[2014-03-11 16:42:46] ddary: i want to change it that the default return type for native is xml
[2014-03-11 16:42:53] ddary: and for web html
[2014-03-11 16:43:02] ddary: like is is described here:
[2014-03-11 16:43:03] ddary: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/spec-draft.md?repo=mobile#83
[2014-03-11 16:43:24] ddary: I will keep the insopector internal format as json
[2014-03-11 16:43:32] lukeis: have you been running the integration tests against the test app? I was getting a lot of failures when running it over the weekend. (also two of the tests I checked in have failures that we need to figure out the issue to :) )
[2014-03-11 16:43:50] lukeis: sounds good :)
[2014-03-11 16:43:54] ddary: ok
[2014-03-11 16:44:20] lukeis: if you are in a webview and find the <body> elementâ€¦ it's immediately stale :)
[2014-03-11 16:44:32] ddary: will work then first on the page source
[2014-03-11 16:44:40] lukeis: please do so :)
[2014-03-11 16:44:53] ddary: tests is another thibng
[2014-03-11 16:44:54] lukeis: i was just mentioning the issue (and that I added failing tests)
[2014-03-11 16:45:09] ddary: :)
[2014-03-11 16:45:35] ddary: wanted to update the atoms and the selenium version as well
[2014-03-11 16:46:15] ddary: looked also at context stuff: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/spec-draft.md?repo=mobile#135
[2014-03-11 16:46:48] ddary: seems like we just need to register the handlers we have to the additional endpoints
[2014-03-11 16:47:17] lukeis: yes
[2014-03-11 16:47:36] lukeis: and that we'll need to add them to the selenium client bindings
[2014-03-11 16:48:25] ddary: to the official ones, right?
[2014-03-11 16:48:31] lukeis: yes
[2014-03-11 16:48:45] ddary: does not make sense to add it to ours
[2014-03-11 16:48:54] lukeis: there is no driver.switchTo().context()
[2014-03-11 16:49:01] ddary: exactly
[2014-03-11 16:49:12] ddary: maybe i do a pull request
[2014-03-11 16:49:16] ddary: :)
[2014-03-11 16:49:22] lukeis: you have commit rights? :)
[2014-03-11 16:49:27] ddary: yes
[2014-03-11 16:49:33] lukeis: then push it!
[2014-03-11 16:49:37] lukeis: (if you change it)
[2014-03-11 16:49:37] ddary: but doing something the first time...
[2014-03-11 16:49:45] lukeis: meh
[2014-03-11 16:49:52] lukeis: we know how to revert changes ;)
[2014-03-11 16:52:27] ddary: :)
[2014-03-11 17:08:35] ddary: lukeis: is there a trick how i can add at runtime to the client driver a new command info to the commandExecutor?
[2014-03-11 17:08:58] lukeis: i know how in python
[2014-03-11 17:09:29] ddary: ok
[2014-03-11 17:10:43] lukeis: in java looks like you'd need to use reflection :) nameToUrl in HttpCommandExecutor
[2014-03-11 17:13:15] lukeis: in pythonâ€¦ driver.command_executor._commands['NEWCOMMAND'] = ('METHOD', '/session/.â€¦.');   driver.execute('NEWCOMMAND')
[2014-03-11 17:13:42] lukeis: where method is get/post/delete :)
[2014-03-11 17:14:37] lukeis: the url actually is '/session/$sessionId/...'  (just to help you with the variable substitution :)
[2014-03-11 17:15:42] ddary: ok
[2014-03-11 17:16:02] ddary: i just used for know the HttpClientUtil
[2014-03-11 17:16:25] ddary: going some layers down
[2014-03-11 17:16:37] lukeis: ok ;) that works too
