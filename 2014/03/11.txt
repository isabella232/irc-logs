[2014-03-11 15:17:55] sascha_: Hi, how do I restart the app without creating a new driver?
[2014-03-11 15:26:06] sascha_: ddary, *highlight* :)
[2014-03-11 15:26:33] ddary: hi sasha_
[2014-03-11 15:26:55] ddary: there is currently no way to do it
[2014-03-11 15:27:03] sascha_: ok
[2014-03-11 15:27:15] ddary: i guess you know that you can start activities via driver.get()
[2014-03-11 15:27:36] ddary: what you can do is, that you start the main activity manually
[2014-03-11 15:28:06] ddary: but that will just start the activity and is of course not an fresh start
[2014-03-11 15:35:58] sascha_: ok driver.get(driver.getCurrentUrl()); seems to work for a hybrid app
[2014-03-11 15:37:31] ddary: if you are in native mode, it is
[2014-03-11 15:38:11] ddary: driver.get("and-activity://io.selendroid.testapp.HomeScreenActivity")

[2014-03-11 16:31:29] ddary: hi lukeis
[2014-03-11 16:31:35] lukeis: hi
[2014-03-11 16:31:43] lukeis: platformVersion makes much more sense :)
[2014-03-11 16:32:03] ddary: :)
[2014-03-11 16:32:31] ddary: so i tested the different variants and it seems like i dodn't break something
[2014-03-11 16:32:45] lukeis: doesn't look like you made it reverse compatible though
[2014-03-11 16:33:00] lukeis: can you pass in "ANDROIDTARGET" ?
[2014-03-11 16:33:27] ddary: yes, if still androidTarget is used
[2014-03-11 16:33:36] ddary: it is still supported
[2014-03-11 16:33:54] ddary: even if you enter ANDROID17 or just 17
[2014-03-11 16:34:02] ddary: all cases should work
[2014-03-11 16:35:09] ddary: do you know, what should be returned as a platform name, if we hit the status servlet?
[2014-03-11 16:35:28] lukeis: i think dalvik
[2014-03-11 16:35:34] ddary: i guess there should be the name of the platform we automate, right?
[2014-03-11 16:35:35] ddary: ok
[2014-03-11 16:35:59] ddary: because currently we return at the standalone x86
[2014-03-11 16:36:47] ddary: or just 'android'?
