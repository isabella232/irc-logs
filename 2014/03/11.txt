[2014-03-11 15:17:55] sascha_: Hi, how do I restart the app without creating a new driver?
[2014-03-11 15:26:06] sascha_: ddary, *highlight* :)
[2014-03-11 15:26:33] ddary: hi sasha_
[2014-03-11 15:26:55] ddary: there is currently no way to do it
[2014-03-11 15:27:03] sascha_: ok
[2014-03-11 15:27:15] ddary: i guess you know that you can start activities via driver.get()
[2014-03-11 15:27:36] ddary: what you can do is, that you start the main activity manually
[2014-03-11 15:28:06] ddary: but that will just start the activity and is of course not an fresh start
[2014-03-11 15:35:58] sascha_: ok driver.get(driver.getCurrentUrl()); seems to work for a hybrid app
[2014-03-11 15:37:31] ddary: if you are in native mode, it is
[2014-03-11 15:38:11] ddary: driver.get("and-activity://io.selendroid.testapp.HomeScreenActivity")
