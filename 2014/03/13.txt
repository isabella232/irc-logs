[2014-03-13 16:24:50] ddary: lukeis hi, ok i see
[2014-03-13 16:25:37] lukeis: also, did you see this? https://github.com/lukeis/selendroid/commit/c5aa40270f4fee1c7013563165ac5d06b8696dab  what do you think about it?
[2014-03-13 16:26:48] ddary: nope, what does it does?
[2014-03-13 16:27:02] lukeis: i'll likely need someone from FB to chime in if they don't want any of those things suppressed
[2014-03-13 16:27:18] lukeis: it suppresses the logcat info from those services listed
[2014-03-13 16:27:51] lukeis: (eliminates the 'extra' stuff no one ever cares about)
[2014-03-13 16:28:36] lukeis: S is 'Silent' (i believe)
[2014-03-13 16:29:10] ddary: sounds good to me
[2014-03-13 16:29:23] lukeis: for example my dev team typically only looks at logcat like this:  `adb logcat Chatter:D  *:S`   (ignoring everything but chatter)
[2014-03-13 16:30:34] ddary: awesome: but why you have not told me that thing before ;-)
[2014-03-13 16:30:42] lukeis: heh :)
[2014-03-13 16:30:46] ddary: could have saved so much time
[2014-03-13 16:30:50] ddary: also build time
[2014-03-13 16:31:22] ddary: on my machine, build the whole project: mvn install -DskipTests is 40 seconds
[2014-03-13 16:31:52] ddary: it is a mac bought in august, 8gb or ram +ssd

[2014-03-13 16:32:21] ddary: how long is the build time on your machine?
[2014-03-13 16:32:22] AutomatedTester: they sell MBP with 8GB still?
[2014-03-13 16:32:24] lukeis: i don't know

[2014-03-13 16:33:02] ddary: AutomatedTester: the new ones have a maximum of 8gb afaik
[2014-03-13 16:33:16] lukeis: :note simonstewart please review 8fd84d75afad624c9c6f03c2f59564b969d3d4f4 in case you guys actually needed to see any of that stuff in the logcat that is now suppressed
[2014-03-13 16:33:33] AutomatedTester: ddary: MBA or MBP?
[2014-03-13 16:33:39] AutomatedTester: ddary: my MBP has 16GB
[2014-03-13 16:33:42] ddary: MBP
[2014-03-13 16:33:54] AutomatedTester: MBP has max of 16GB
[2014-03-13 16:33:55] ddary: is this a new new one?
[2014-03-13 16:34:02] AutomatedTester: I got this 18 months
[2014-03-13 16:34:03] AutomatedTester: ago
[2014-03-13 16:34:08] ddary: my old one had this as well ;-)
[2014-03-13 16:34:41] lukeis: `mvn clean install -DskipTests=true`  on my machine just took 34s
[2014-03-13 16:36:06] lukeis: changing it to be 10s  feels like such a micro optimization to meâ€¦. comparing my current work build which takes ~90min (and everyone knows could / should be mere minutes or less)
[2014-03-13 16:37:43] lukeis: i have 16GB of ram
[2014-03-13 16:37:48] lukeis: MBP
[2014-03-13 16:38:38] lukeis: got this one ~9 months ago
[2014-03-13 16:38:59] ddary: ok
[2014-03-13 16:39:32] ddary: wow 90 min build
[2014-03-13 16:39:51] lukeis: well, build + starting server
[2014-03-13 16:40:44] lukeis: (this is from scratchâ€¦ which i do on weekly basis, although I'd love to do it daily, but can't cause it takes too long!)
[2014-03-13 16:42:55] lukeis: :snapshot
[2014-03-13 16:44:50] lukeis: oh :(  ddary you merged #292
[2014-03-13 16:45:08] lukeis: the spec finally has batching in it
[2014-03-13 16:45:24] lukeis: so, i really don't like using executeScript for things
[2014-03-13 16:45:34] *lukeis gonna rip that out soon enough ;)'
[2014-03-13 16:57:32] *lukeis just sent simon stewart a linkedin request for the pure purpose of 'endorsing' him for maven :)'
[2014-03-13 17:11:13] ddary: lukeis: i have the same opinion like you about that. but implement multi touch is i guess a larger task (with creation of the acticity in the testapp for testing)
[2014-03-13 17:11:41] lukeis: yep
[2014-03-13 17:11:42] ddary: and for that, we have it know there, when people ask we can say, we are working on it
