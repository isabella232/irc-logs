[2014-03-06 18:02:42] ddary: a bit
[2014-03-06 18:02:48] lukeis: :)
[2014-03-06 18:02:51] ddary: how are things?
[2014-03-06 18:02:54] lukeis: well
[2014-03-06 18:03:24] ddary: sounds good
[2014-03-06 18:03:59] *lukeis currently working on adding async execute script support (which means adding support for the timeouts endpoints too)'
[2014-03-06 18:04:32] ddary: ah, is that a big thing?
[2014-03-06 18:04:56] lukeis: it shouldn't beâ€¦ but my changes keep growing ;)
[2014-03-06 18:05:02] ddary: just asking because i have not looked into it
[2014-03-06 18:05:08] ddary: i know
[2014-03-06 18:05:11] ddary: the problem
[2014-03-06 18:05:20] lukeis: there's an Atom for it, but it needs to be called in a custom way for us
[2014-03-06 18:05:44] ddary: sounds like you have fun ;-)
