[2014-03-06 18:02:35] ddary: hi
[2014-03-06 18:02:42] ddary: a bit
[2014-03-06 18:02:48] lukeis: :)
[2014-03-06 18:02:51] ddary: how are things?
[2014-03-06 18:02:54] lukeis: well
[2014-03-06 18:03:24] ddary: sounds good
[2014-03-06 18:03:59] *lukeis currently working on adding async execute script support (which means adding support for the timeouts endpoints too)'
[2014-03-06 18:04:32] ddary: ah, is that a big thing?
[2014-03-06 18:04:56] lukeis: it shouldn't beâ€¦ but my changes keep growing ;)
[2014-03-06 18:05:02] ddary: just asking because i have not looked into it
[2014-03-06 18:05:08] ddary: i know
[2014-03-06 18:05:11] ddary: the problem
[2014-03-06 18:05:20] lukeis: there's an Atom for it, but it needs to be called in a custom way for us
[2014-03-06 18:05:44] ddary: sounds like you have fun ;-)

[2014-03-06 18:06:29] ddary: currently i don't know how to exactly fix some of the emulator issues
[2014-03-06 18:06:31] lukeis: have a review of that ^ :)
[2014-03-06 18:07:24] ddary: good you added it
[2014-03-06 18:07:31] ddary: i forgot it
[2014-03-06 18:08:06] lukeis: i see you modeled the native events after ios-driver
[2014-03-06 18:08:09] ddary: simon said he has a diff for moving to betty
[2014-03-06 18:08:13] ddary: yep
[2014-03-06 18:08:25] ddary: i had a chat with francois ;-)
[2014-03-06 18:08:46] lukeis: this should be brought up in a spec discussion
[2014-03-06 18:09:54] lukeis: netty*  (not betty?) :)
[2014-03-06 18:10:27] ddary: ;-)
[2014-03-06 18:25:04] lukeis: ddary: so, you broke -installedApp ?
[2014-03-06 18:25:12] lukeis: err, removed it? or something
[2014-03-06 18:25:17] lukeis: i have to look into it...
[2014-03-06 18:30:44] ddary: removed it completely
[2014-03-06 18:30:50] ddary: :)
[2014-03-06 18:30:54] lukeis: ddary: ok, you removed itâ€¦ (I could have used a bit of fair warning there :) ) and likely others who depend on it will not realize either
[2014-03-06 18:31:03] lukeis: alsoâ€¦ it doesn't 'work' ;)
[2014-03-06 18:31:34] lukeis: co-worker got:   SEVERE: Ignoring app because it was not found: /home/d.chang/dev/android/com.salesforce.chatter/Chatter
[2014-03-06 18:31:48] lukeis: oh, nm
[2014-03-06 18:32:30] lukeis: he didn't pass in the apk he passed in what he did to -installedApp ;)
[2014-03-06 18:33:06] ddary: yeah
[2014-03-06 18:33:16] ddary: i know that could have been smoother
[2014-03-06 18:33:20] ddary: sorry
[2014-03-06 18:33:21] lukeis: okâ€¦ now i have to retrain the android team :-/
[2014-03-06 18:34:01] ddary: the thing is, it turned out to be better to have it clean
[2014-03-06 18:34:18] ddary: so, if he passes the apt, everything should be the same
[2014-03-06 18:34:26] lukeis: sounds good
[2014-03-06 18:34:32] lukeis: i'll have them try ;)
[2014-03-06 18:34:50] ddary: the started emulators can be used
[2014-03-06 18:35:01] lukeis: and it doesn't shut them down?
[2014-03-06 18:35:02] lukeis: :)
[2014-03-06 18:35:13] ddary: but also the ones that got started after the server got started
[2014-03-06 18:35:16] ddary: no
[2014-03-06 18:35:31] ddary: if selendroid is starting an emulator
[2014-03-06 18:35:38] ddary: it shuts them down
[2014-03-06 18:35:46] lukeis: ok :)
[2014-03-06 18:35:52] ddary: if it was started externally: not
[2014-03-06 18:36:32] ddary: only the app get closed
[2014-03-06 18:36:55] lukeis: yep, that's the expected behavior for me :)
[2014-03-06 18:37:47] ddary: good
[2014-03-06 18:38:25] lukeis: i'll 'fix' things when my developers start complainingâ€¦ otherwise I'm not looking into it ;)  3 other things I'm working on right now! :-D
[2014-03-06 18:39:20] ddary: ok
[2014-03-06 18:39:34] ddary: what are you working on?
[2014-03-06 18:39:59] ddary: - the async script
[2014-03-06 18:40:49] lukeis: that and two things for work :)
[2014-03-06 18:41:05] lukeis: (that won't mean changes to 'selendroid' though)
[2014-03-06 18:41:23] ddary: ok, got it
[2014-03-06 18:41:37] ddary: just wanted to make sure we are not working on the same stuff
[2014-03-06 18:42:06] lukeis: our app doesn't allow you to specify an insecure server to connect toâ€¦ so I have to rebuild it for every instance url in our testing environment
[2014-03-06 18:42:31] lukeis: (i have a jenkins job to do it and i'm having the test code remotely trigger a job to get the appropriate apk)
[2014-03-06 18:42:36] lukeis: this is my current 'fun' ;)
[2014-03-06 18:46:45] ddary: :)
[2014-03-06 19:18:01] Guest67982: hey guys... is there any way to trace an INSTRUMENTATION_FAILED error?
