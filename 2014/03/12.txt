[2014-03-12 17:38:32] lukeis: ddary: ok :) want to push it to a fork in github?
[2014-03-12 17:38:58] ddary: lukeis: i have a diff
[2014-03-12 17:39:19] ddary: because i'm working directly with the google code system
[2014-03-12 17:39:33] lukeis: you can push from any git repo to any git repo ;)
[2014-03-12 17:39:51] ddary: right
[2014-03-12 17:40:00] lukeis: click the 'fork' link from the seleniumhq repo so you don't have to push the 4+GB of data yourself
