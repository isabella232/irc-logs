[2014-03-27 16:14:29] martink_: The command is e.g. 'adb -s I7SS8PVS8DIRIB95 forward tcp:9413 tcp:9413'

[2014-03-27 16:43:47] martink_: (with the tag Selendroid)
[2014-03-27 16:44:13] martink_: Currently messages from Selendroid show up in logcat like this: 03-27 07:42:39.577 I/System.out( 6236): Instrumentation initialized with main activity:
[2014-03-27 16:44:22] lukeis: don't mind at all, I don't think dominik nor myself are very good 'android developers' ;)
[2014-03-27 16:45:14] martink_: System.out is hard to distinguish from other processes that might also be doing println().
[2014-03-27 16:45:17] martink_: OK thanks!

[2014-03-27 17:16:26] samuelhorwitz: lukeis, I was messing around with all the stuff this morning
[2014-03-27 17:16:51] samuelhorwitz: The reason why my site wont load through Protractor seems to be that the check for Angular function is somehow eventually getting undefined returned
[2014-03-27 17:17:08] samuelhorwitz: I cant see any errors on the page itself when inspecting with Chrome debugging
[2014-03-27 17:17:56] samuelhorwitz: But after the check for angular tests all run until timeout, my Protractor session fails saying it couldnt get index 0 of undefined on a line that indicates the undefined value was supposed to be an array with index 0 indicating successfully finding Angular
[2014-03-27 17:17:56] lukeis: so it fails in the chrome webview too?
[2014-03-27 17:17:59] samuelhorwitz: yeah
[2014-03-27 17:18:33] samuelhorwitz: I'll keep looking into it in my free time, I'm not sure where this actually traces back to still
[2014-03-27 17:18:57] lukeis: sounds like a bug in the library for android in particular :) (always fun...)
[2014-03-27 17:19:06] samuelhorwitz: But basically the executeAsyncScript result handler expects an array like [true, null] or [false, 'error message'] and instead gets undefined
[2014-03-27 17:20:09] samuelhorwitz: Im using emulator btw
[2014-03-27 17:20:26] samuelhorwitz: I'm able to get chrome debugging on the API level 19 build
[2014-03-27 17:20:32] samuelhorwitz: And I couldnt see any console errors
[2014-03-27 17:20:57] samuelhorwitz: I see the basics of my page layed out without continuing to boot up into angular, something that doesnt happen in either Chrome for Android or Stock browser
[2014-03-27 17:23:03] lukeis: what about if you hit a link from something like the twitter app and it launches a webview?
[2014-03-27 17:23:37] samuelhorwitz: hmm that is a good question ill take a look
[2014-03-27 17:23:41] samuelhorwitz: I know ive tested that on iOS
[2014-03-27 17:29:30] samuelhorwitz: just got my friend to try opening something up in his Feedify app
[2014-03-27 17:29:33] samuelhorwitz: on Android
[2014-03-27 17:29:35] samuelhorwitz: it all looks good
[2014-03-27 17:30:07] samuelhorwitz: twitter just opens chrome up separately

[2014-03-27 18:42:32] samuelhorwitz: The issue from what I can tell seems to be related to window variable in the executeAsyncScript context

[2014-03-27 18:46:08] lukeis: ahh, ok, that I can check on :)
[2014-03-27 18:47:11] samuelhorwitz: Im still looking because it appears to be available before that point, like alert and settimeout all work...
[2014-03-27 18:47:19] samuelhorwitz: but thats just sort of a minddump of where I am
[2014-03-27 18:47:24] samuelhorwitz: ill keep commenting on it with updates
[2014-03-27 19:12:09] samuelhorwitz: lukeis: just updated after more digging
[2014-03-27 19:12:14] samuelhorwitz: its not window
[2014-03-27 19:12:17] samuelhorwitz: its setTimeout
[2014-03-27 19:12:29] samuelhorwitz: setTimeout does not work except for very small millisecond values
[2014-03-27 19:12:33] samuelhorwitz: I have absolutely no idea why
[2014-03-27 19:13:27] samuelhorwitz: https://gist.github.com/samuelhorwitz/5d9b10855d90a5589311#comment-1200610
[2014-03-27 19:19:25] lukeis: seems a common problem on android webview?
[2014-03-27 19:19:27] lukeis: https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/114111/bug-sometimes-settimeout-doesnt-work-on-android
[2014-03-27 19:19:39] lukeis: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3488764/settimeout-not-called-in-android-webkit
[2014-03-27 19:22:02] samuelhorwitz: interesting
[2014-03-27 19:22:10] samuelhorwitz: let me try doing the var function declaration pattern for this code
[2014-03-27 19:22:19] samuelhorwitz: I did notice this also in the tests
[2014-03-27 19:22:21] samuelhorwitz: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/761e9ba05cec3834d95078116cab587795b6a1ab/selendroid-test-app/src/test/java/io/selendroid/driver/ExecuteAsyncScriptTest.java#L144
[2014-03-27 19:22:48] samuelhorwitz: I cant tell if it expects these situations to never arise and handle them as errors?
[2014-03-27 19:23:01] samuelhorwitz: I dont think it should do that
[2014-03-27 19:23:03] samuelhorwitz: if it does
[2014-03-27 19:23:35] lukeis: that's a different use case than yours
[2014-03-27 19:23:41] samuelhorwitz: okay
[2014-03-27 19:24:04] lukeis: that one is in particular testing the timeout function (script timeout) where callback isn't called 'in time'
[2014-03-27 19:24:24] samuelhorwitz: ahh okay
[2014-03-27 19:24:25] samuelhorwitz: yes
[2014-03-27 19:24:29] samuelhorwitz: that test should be there then lol
[2014-03-27 19:24:36] samuelhorwitz: I just added one like that to ios-driver yesterday
[2014-03-27 19:24:53] lukeis: these tests were mostly just copy / pasted from the Selenium project
[2014-03-27 19:25:17] samuelhorwitz: Yeah I copied my tests from the normal executeScript tests and then just did them all async
[2014-03-27 19:25:23] samuelhorwitz: And then wrote an extra one
[2014-03-27 19:25:28] samuelhorwitz: for the timeout stuff
[2014-03-27 19:26:06] lukeis: well there's a whole set of 'asyncExcecuteScript' tests too :)
[2014-03-27 19:42:31] samuelhorwitz: hmm I tried making the setTimeout function a reference to a function instead of an anonymous one
[2014-03-27 19:42:43] samuelhorwitz: It doesnt seem to work
[2014-03-27 19:42:52] samuelhorwitz: All those issues seem to be from 2011 with the Android 2.x series
[2014-03-27 19:43:32] samuelhorwitz: Its still very weird because it seems directly tied to timeout time in milliseconds * number of times setTimeout is called
[2014-03-27 19:43:43] samuelhorwitz: Like if I set it to 10, it works with only 10 calls but not with 100
[2014-03-27 19:43:50] samuelhorwitz: but if its 1000 it doesnt even work with one call
[2014-03-27 19:44:02] samuelhorwitz: I really have no clue what this could be lol
[2014-03-27 19:44:56] lukeis: very odd… sorry, i haven't had time to play around with it today and not likely i will either :-/
[2014-03-27 19:46:34] samuelhorwitz: no worries I will keep messing around
