[2014-03-27 16:14:17] martink_: Hi guys, I noticed we set up port forwarding before talking to the Selendroid server on the device. What is the reasoning behind it / is it necessary? Thanks!
[2014-03-27 16:14:29] martink_: The command is e.g. 'adb -s I7SS8PVS8DIRIB95 forward tcp:9413 tcp:9413'

[2014-03-27 16:43:47] martink_: (with the tag Selendroid)
[2014-03-27 16:44:13] martink_: Currently messages from Selendroid show up in logcat like this: 03-27 07:42:39.577 I/System.out( 6236): Instrumentation initialized with main activity:
[2014-03-27 16:44:22] lukeis: don't mind at all, I don't think dominik nor myself are very good 'android developers' ;)
[2014-03-27 16:45:14] martink_: System.out is hard to distinguish from other processes that might also be doing println().
[2014-03-27 16:45:17] martink_: OK thanks!
