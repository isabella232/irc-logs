[2014-02-05 08:33:12] ddary: :note lukeis the only thing that needs to be updated as well before we annouce the release is the documentation. Biggest change is the usage of port 4444.

[2014-02-05 09:33:35] ddary: Hi bhans1
[2014-02-05 09:37:38] bhans1: hi ddary :)
[2014-02-05 09:37:44] ddary: Hi
[2014-02-05 09:37:52] ddary: you have written the tweet, right?
[2014-02-05 09:37:56] bhans1: yep haha
[2014-02-05 09:37:57] bhans1: :D
[2014-02-05 09:38:00] ddary: :)
[2014-02-05 09:38:13] ddary: glad you like the framework
[2014-02-05 09:38:21] bhans1: yep, it's pretty good
[2014-02-05 09:38:43] ddary: what do you really want to do? was robolectric the stuff you are looking for?
[2014-02-05 09:39:31] bhans1: been using robotium and robolectric. just thought if selendroid does support those things :D
[2014-02-05 09:39:53] bhans1: but the thing that no need of source code is pretty self-explainable
[2014-02-05 09:40:03] ddary: yeah, it is just build for end-to-end testing
[2014-02-05 09:40:08] ddary: ok
[2014-02-05 09:40:19] bhans1: hahaha, I was just wondering if I could use it for white-box, coz I really loved it :D
[2014-02-05 09:40:40] bhans1: are you the only one who commits?
[2014-02-05 09:41:06] ddary: but we are currently thinking about adding support for user extensions: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/commit/5c4c0fbe14fded2dcc773303ab1b52b21ccd7921
[2014-02-05 09:41:36] ddary: no, I'm not the only one who does the work: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/AUTHORS
[2014-02-05 09:41:58] ddary: I created it, but without the community the tool would not be where it is
[2014-02-05 09:42:09] bhans1: ahh.. nice :D
[2014-02-05 09:43:03] bhans1: I really appreciate it! hehehe
[2014-02-05 09:45:36] ddary: thanks
[2014-02-05 09:45:54] bhans1: btw, I encountered about the 0.8.0
[2014-02-05 09:46:11] bhans1: a problem*
[2014-02-05 09:46:29] bhans1: usually, mac doesnt accept "localhost" but instead 127.0.0.1
[2014-02-05 09:46:40] bhans1: i mean, not all machine are configured that way
[2014-02-05 09:47:01] bhans1: so, I recompiled and made changes, then it worked
[2014-02-05 09:47:29] bhans1: am I the only one who encountered this problem? haha
[2014-02-05 09:49:29] ddary: hearing the first time
[2014-02-05 09:49:38] ddary: so, what are the changes you did?
[2014-02-05 09:49:47] bhans1: just changed all localhost to 127.0.0.1
[2014-02-05 09:50:21] bhans1: been searching about mac, they restricted using localhost, but other versions maybe unrestricted or devs just open it
[2014-02-05 09:50:33] bhans1: im currently on 10.9.1
[2014-02-05 09:51:32] ddary: you changed it in your tests in the demoproject, right?
[2014-02-05 09:53:32] ddary: btw: with the release of the 0.8.0 you don't have to specify anymore the url of the selendroid-standalone because we are now using selenium's default port 4444
[2014-02-05 09:54:00] bhans1: yes, but still not locating locahost
[2014-02-05 09:54:16] bhans1: when I recompiled it with 127.0.0.1, then no more unresolved host
[2014-02-05 09:54:17] bhans1: errors
[2014-02-05 09:58:21] bhans1: wait, let me just send you ;)
[2014-02-05 10:17:11] bhans1: here you go: http://pastebin.com/G66p9ZB7
[2014-02-05 10:22:10] bhans1: btw, that's in selendroid-standalone
[2014-02-05 10:23:17] ddary: thanks for the pointer, now i know that you mean exactly
[2014-02-05 10:23:53] ddary: can you create an issue for it?
[2014-02-05 10:24:18] ddary: than we will probably change it before we release the 0.8.0
[2014-02-05 10:26:07] bhans1: in github?
[2014-02-05 10:26:21] ddary: yep
[2014-02-05 10:26:31] bhans1: sure :)
[2014-02-05 10:27:33] ddary: thanks

[2014-02-05 17:17:01] simonstewart: ddary: oleks has been profiling selendroid. Expect some performance tweaks to land soon
[2014-02-05 17:17:22] ddary: hi simonstewart
[2014-02-05 17:17:31] ddary: sounds good
[2014-02-05 17:17:41] ddary: what are the main issues?
[2014-02-05 17:17:52] simonstewart: Using SecureRandom lots when we generate UUID
[2014-02-05 17:17:53] simonstewart: s
[2014-02-05 17:18:14] simonstewart: and the code in "isFor" when matching a URL to the handler is also super-churny
[2014-02-05 17:18:30] ddary: note: lukeis it is probably a good idea to wait until simonstewart has landed the performance tweaks
[2014-02-05 17:18:49] ddary: :note lukeis it is probably a good idea to wait until simonstewart has landed the performance tweaks
[2014-02-05 17:19:04] ddary: simonstewart: ok
[2014-02-05 17:19:14] simonstewart: Thanks
[2014-02-05 17:19:19] ddary: lukeis had planned to ship the release today
[2014-02-05 17:19:38] simonstewart: Should be landing today
[2014-02-05 17:19:42] simonstewart: Before I go into meetings :)
[2014-02-05 17:19:58] ddary: :)
[2014-02-05 17:20:28] ddary: have you seen the tweet about stickers? i know it is not the most important thing in the world...
[2014-02-05 17:20:54] simonstewart: Not seen it, but I bloody love stickers :)
[2014-02-05 17:21:44] simonstewart: I've also got a change that reduces the use of reflection in the servlets, but I'll wait for the release before landing that
[2014-02-05 17:22:49] ddary: ok
[2014-02-05 17:23:58] ddary: The latest add on from my side (execute script) is not optimal and I know you don't like it ;-) but I got an internal request. now my customers are happy, so that is also important..
[2014-02-05 17:24:28] simonstewart: I'm cleaning up a diff that does something similar
[2014-02-05 17:24:43] ddary: ok
[2014-02-05 17:25:01] simonstewart: I'll stick it up on my fork for you to take a look at before I do anything with it
[2014-02-05 17:31:42] Ragnaroek: the documentation around Mobile Web testing is a little unclear: Does selendroid use a special WebView app or the native browser?
[2014-02-05 17:33:09] ddary: Ragnoroek: a special web view app
[2014-02-05 17:34:34] ddary: Ragnoroek: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/tree/master/android-driver

[2014-02-05 17:35:48] Ragnaroek: support
[2014-02-05 17:40:24] ddary: chromedriver on newer devices can do it. for older devices you can only go with web view approach as far as I know.
[2014-02-05 17:41:01] ddary: As far as I know, adding chromedriver as a dependency it not planned at the moment
[2014-02-05 17:41:17] ddary: but I would ask lukeis for that.
[2014-02-05 17:41:45] ddary: he usally arrives in 20 min from now
[2014-02-05 17:44:41] smccarthy: On http://selendroid.io/setup.html#DesiredCapabilities , it has a link for Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator that doesn't work. Should the link be updated to : http://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/installation-instructions-for-intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager-windows
[2014-02-05 17:44:41] smccarthy: ?

[2014-02-05 19:55:26] ddary: Hi lukeis
[2014-02-05 19:55:33] lukeis: hi ddary
[2014-02-05 19:55:45] lukeis: release time :)
[2014-02-05 19:55:52] ddary: :)
[2014-02-05 19:56:18] lukeis: are you ok with 0.8  or do you want it to have 3 points? 0.8.0 ?
[2014-02-05 19:57:16] ddary: I have always use the longer syntax because then we can also easily ship fixes
[2014-02-05 19:57:49] lukeis: we can either way ;) but I'll stick with your convention
[2014-02-05 19:57:55] ddary: why do you want to use the short version? Selenium uses as well three digits, right?
[2014-02-05 19:58:46] lukeis: selenium does it for a particular purpose (since there's really like 6 projects in one)
[2014-02-05 19:59:35] lukeis: i don't really have an argument for or against either way
[2014-02-05 20:01:54] ddary: i prefer the schema i have used :D
[2014-02-05 20:02:15] *lukeis will do that ;)'
[2014-02-05 20:02:17] ddary: ok
[2014-02-05 20:02:43] ddary: with regards to the docu, should I change it or you will do it?
[2014-02-05 20:03:33] lukeis: i'm trying to… but I appear to be not doing so awesome at awestruct… missing a gem or something
[2014-02-05 20:04:02] ddary: ok, no problem
[2014-02-05 20:04:27] ddary: but sadly i cannot do it today, but will get it done tomorrow
[2014-02-05 20:04:41] lukeis: i'll likely be able to figure it out ;)
[2014-02-05 20:06:23] ddary: with regards to awestruct i just looked into my evernote and found nothing, so it means it just worked
[2014-02-05 20:07:13] lukeis: me + ruby have a long sorted history… we don't always play nice together ;)
[2014-02-05 20:08:30] ddary: with regards to the web view touch tests: i have seen in the selenium project are quite some tests. would be nice to have them as well in our project. So, what is the suggested approach: just copy it or how can they be easily executed?
[2014-02-05 20:13:11] ddary: will be back in a second
[2014-02-05 20:17:24] ddary: back
[2014-02-05 20:18:40] lukeis: ddary: hmm, do you code sign? what command do you use to deploy?
[2014-02-05 20:50:40] lukeis: figured it out… :-D

[2014-02-05 21:03:50] simonstewart: Go ahead
[2014-02-05 21:04:05] *lukeis teasing :) oh how i love to tease...'
[2014-02-05 21:04:15] ddary: :)
[2014-02-05 21:06:12] lukeis: wow, that is the fastest sync to central i've ever seen
[2014-02-05 21:07:29] lukeis: sonatype must finally be *doing something* about that bad reputation to get releases out
[2014-02-05 21:14:51] ddary: lukeis: thanks for pushing the release!
[2014-02-05 21:15:12] lukeis: :) hopefully i didn't screw too many things up ;)
[2014-02-05 21:16:06] ddary: i don't think so. And if it will happen, we just release again
[2014-02-05 21:17:52] simonstewart: Just cleaned up the patch
[2014-02-05 21:17:54] simonstewart: Running tests
[2014-02-05 21:21:48] simonstewart: BTW, I had someone ask me if it was possible to build selendroid without the web bits
[2014-02-05 21:21:57] simonstewart: so just the native code
[2014-02-05 21:22:00] simonstewart: I had a bit of a weep
[2014-02-05 21:22:26] lukeis: heh
[2014-02-05 21:22:51] lukeis: i would just tell them "no" and turn back around
[2014-02-05 21:23:19] simonstewart: It was to do with performance testing. They were concerned by the amount of memory that the selendroid server takes up
[2014-02-05 21:23:39] lukeis: -noWebViewApp  (or whatever that option was)
[2014-02-05 21:23:47] ddary: do you know what the resin behind that question was?
[2014-02-05 21:24:09] simonstewart: The memory consumption of the selendroid process
[2014-02-05 21:24:14] lukeis: ah
[2014-02-05 21:24:47] lukeis: webview bits don't get instantiated until your request to switch to a webview right?
[2014-02-05 21:24:57] simonstewart: Dunno
[2014-02-05 21:24:59] ddary: exactly
[2014-02-05 21:25:01] simonstewart: It's on my list of things to read
[2014-02-05 21:25:28] lukeis: i recall seeing that… can't point right to the code place
[2014-02-05 21:25:43] *simonstewart gestures vaguely in the direction of the codebase'
[2014-02-05 21:26:05] simonstewart: "over there"
[2014-02-05 21:26:12] lukeis: yeah… somewhere in there… https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/tree/master/selendroid-server
[2014-02-05 21:26:15] lukeis: ;)

[2014-02-05 21:28:24] simonstewart: Aye

[2014-02-05 21:32:09] simonstewart: That's totally fucked up
[2014-02-05 21:34:12] simonstewart: Furrfu
[2014-02-05 21:34:17] simonstewart: Right. Fine.

[2014-02-05 21:34:27] simonstewart: Those last messages are filthy lies
[2014-02-05 21:34:42] simonstewart: r187eff3c was the interesting diff
[2014-02-05 21:35:23] lukeis:  187eff3c
[2014-02-05 21:35:36] lukeis: oh yeah, the bot doesn't have that update
[2014-02-05 21:36:18] lukeis: that was already in there?
[2014-02-05 21:36:23] simonstewart: Apparently
[2014-02-05 21:36:27] simonstewart: Oh well.
[2014-02-05 21:36:30] simonstewart: It's a nice change :)
[2014-02-05 21:36:41] lukeis: heh and in 0.8
[2014-02-05 21:39:10] ddary: lukeis: with regards to the web view touch tests: i have seen in the selenium project are quite some tests. would be nice to have them as well in our project. So, what is the suggested approach: just copy it or how can they be easily executed?
[2014-02-05 21:41:29] lukeis: we can likely execute them from the selenium project
[2014-02-05 21:41:56] lukeis: it's a minor adventure in 'crazy-fun' and maybe a little bit a java-ing
[2014-02-05 21:44:04] ddary: k
