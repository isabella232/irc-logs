[2014-02-05 08:22:13] ddary: :note lukeis Oh cool! no, i have not anything important in the pipeline.
[2014-02-05 08:33:12] ddary: :note lukeis the only thing that needs to be updated as well before we annouce the release is the documentation. Biggest change is the usage of port 4444.

[2014-02-05 09:33:35] ddary: Hi bhans1
[2014-02-05 09:37:38] bhans1: hi ddary :)
[2014-02-05 09:37:44] ddary: Hi
[2014-02-05 09:37:52] ddary: you have written the tweet, right?
[2014-02-05 09:37:56] bhans1: yep haha
[2014-02-05 09:37:57] bhans1: :D
[2014-02-05 09:38:00] ddary: :)
[2014-02-05 09:38:13] ddary: glad you like the framework
[2014-02-05 09:38:21] bhans1: yep, it's pretty good
[2014-02-05 09:38:43] ddary: what do you really want to do? was robolectric the stuff you are looking for?
[2014-02-05 09:39:31] bhans1: been using robotium and robolectric. just thought if selendroid does support those things :D
[2014-02-05 09:39:53] bhans1: but the thing that no need of source code is pretty self-explainable
[2014-02-05 09:40:03] ddary: yeah, it is just build for end-to-end testing
[2014-02-05 09:40:08] ddary: ok
[2014-02-05 09:40:19] bhans1: hahaha, I was just wondering if I could use it for white-box, coz I really loved it :D
[2014-02-05 09:40:40] bhans1: are you the only one who commits?
[2014-02-05 09:41:06] ddary: but we are currently thinking about adding support for user extensions: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/commit/5c4c0fbe14fded2dcc773303ab1b52b21ccd7921
[2014-02-05 09:41:36] ddary: no, I'm not the only one who does the work: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/AUTHORS
[2014-02-05 09:41:58] ddary: I created it, but without the community the tool would not be where it is
[2014-02-05 09:42:09] bhans1: ahh.. nice :D
[2014-02-05 09:43:03] bhans1: I really appreciate it! hehehe
[2014-02-05 09:45:36] ddary: thanks
[2014-02-05 09:45:54] bhans1: btw, I encountered about the 0.8.0
[2014-02-05 09:46:11] bhans1: a problem*
[2014-02-05 09:46:29] bhans1: usually, mac doesnt accept "localhost" but instead 127.0.0.1
[2014-02-05 09:46:40] bhans1: i mean, not all machine are configured that way
[2014-02-05 09:47:01] bhans1: so, I recompiled and made changes, then it worked
[2014-02-05 09:47:29] bhans1: am I the only one who encountered this problem? haha
[2014-02-05 09:49:29] ddary: hearing the first time
[2014-02-05 09:49:38] ddary: so, what are the changes you did?
[2014-02-05 09:49:47] bhans1: just changed all localhost to 127.0.0.1
[2014-02-05 09:50:21] bhans1: been searching about mac, they restricted using localhost, but other versions maybe unrestricted or devs just open it
[2014-02-05 09:50:33] bhans1: im currently on 10.9.1
[2014-02-05 09:51:32] ddary: you changed it in your tests in the demoproject, right?
[2014-02-05 09:53:32] ddary: btw: with the release of the 0.8.0 you don't have to specify anymore the url of the selendroid-standalone because we are now using selenium's default port 4444
[2014-02-05 09:54:00] bhans1: yes, but still not locating locahost
[2014-02-05 09:54:16] bhans1: when I recompiled it with 127.0.0.1, then no more unresolved host
[2014-02-05 09:54:17] bhans1: errors
[2014-02-05 09:58:21] bhans1: wait, let me just send you ;)
[2014-02-05 10:17:11] bhans1: here you go: http://pastebin.com/G66p9ZB7
[2014-02-05 10:22:10] bhans1: btw, that's in selendroid-standalone
[2014-02-05 10:23:17] ddary: thanks for the pointer, now i know that you mean exactly
[2014-02-05 10:23:53] ddary: can you create an issue for it?
[2014-02-05 10:24:18] ddary: than we will probably change it before we release the 0.8.0
[2014-02-05 10:26:07] bhans1: in github?
[2014-02-05 10:26:21] ddary: yep
[2014-02-05 10:26:31] bhans1: sure :)
[2014-02-05 10:27:33] ddary: thanks
