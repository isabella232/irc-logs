[2014-02-11 12:25:25] yashas: hey
[2014-02-11 12:26:07] yashas: if u need any other info just let me know
[2014-02-11 12:26:14] ddary: first: what you can try it that u use an emulator with a smaller screen size e.g. 320x480
[2014-02-11 12:26:27] yashas: ok
[2014-02-11 12:26:35] ddary: second: in your browser are diffeent timeouts used
[2014-02-11 12:26:54] yashas: mobile or pc browser?
[2014-02-11 12:27:37] ddary: the issue is, that reading the framebuffer of the device will take a while, too long to display it in the browser. what can happen is, that no image or only a partial image is displayed
[2014-02-11 12:27:52] ddary: the android emualor screen size
[2014-02-11 12:28:26] ddary: i found until now no good way to load the images asyncronously
[2014-02-11 12:28:41] ddary: if you have a good way, please let me know
[2014-02-11 12:29:05] yashas: the ram size and vm ?
[2014-02-11 12:29:23] yashas: is that necessay to be 1gb ram and 32 mb
[2014-02-11 12:29:43] ddary: i made the best results with it
[2014-02-11 12:30:08] ddary: what is your host setup, which OS you use?
[2014-02-11 12:30:33] yashas: have u tried with lower settings.. will that effect anyway the image in inspector
