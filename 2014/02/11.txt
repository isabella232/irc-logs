[2014-02-11 12:25:04] ddary: hi yashas, just have seen your messages
[2014-02-11 12:25:08] ddary: :log
[2014-02-11 12:25:25] yashas: hey
[2014-02-11 12:26:07] yashas: if u need any other info just let me know
[2014-02-11 12:26:14] ddary: first: what you can try it that u use an emulator with a smaller screen size e.g. 320x480
[2014-02-11 12:26:27] yashas: ok
[2014-02-11 12:26:35] ddary: second: in your browser are diffeent timeouts used
[2014-02-11 12:26:54] yashas: mobile or pc browser?
[2014-02-11 12:27:37] ddary: the issue is, that reading the framebuffer of the device will take a while, too long to display it in the browser. what can happen is, that no image or only a partial image is displayed
[2014-02-11 12:27:52] ddary: the android emualor screen size
[2014-02-11 12:28:26] ddary: i found until now no good way to load the images asyncronously
[2014-02-11 12:28:41] ddary: if you have a good way, please let me know
[2014-02-11 12:29:05] yashas: the ram size and vm ?
[2014-02-11 12:29:23] yashas: is that necessay to be 1gb ram and 32 mb
[2014-02-11 12:29:43] ddary: i made the best results with it
[2014-02-11 12:30:08] ddary: what is your host setup, which OS you use?
[2014-02-11 12:30:33] yashas: have u tried with lower settings.. will that effect anyway the image in inspector

[2014-02-11 12:31:50] friscodelrosario: Hi, Simon.
[2014-02-11 12:32:06] simonstewart: hi
[2014-02-11 12:32:07] simonstewart: :)
[2014-02-11 12:32:08] ddary: yashas: does this run inside a vm?
[2014-02-11 12:32:28] yashas: no
[2014-02-11 12:32:50] yashas: its on my laptop(intel based)
[2014-02-11 12:33:27] simonstewart: ddary: I'm working on getting selendroid building using buck
[2014-02-11 12:34:06] ddary: simonstewart: I already wondered how long it will take until you work on it ;-)
[2014-02-11 12:34:48] simonstewart: And I'm seeing that the name used for the ServerInstrumentation on the device is "instrumentation:io.selendroid/.ServerInstrumentation"
[2014-02-11 12:34:50] ddary: i tried it a while ago and built the selendroid-server
[2014-02-11 12:35:04] simonstewart: whereas I'm expecting it to be "instrumentation:io.selendroid/io.selendroid.ServerInstrumentation"
[2014-02-11 12:35:13] simonstewart: Any idea how that instrumentation name is selected?
[2014-02-11 12:35:27] ddary: from a timing perspective the build time compared to maven was the same. so i kept the current version.
[2014-02-11 12:35:40] simonstewart: OK
[2014-02-11 12:35:52] simonstewart: There are other reasons why I need to get it working with buck :)
[2014-02-11 12:36:20] simonstewart: So: any idea how that instrumentation name is selected or generated?
[2014-02-11 12:36:44] ddary: no, i don't know - sorry
[2014-02-11 12:36:48] simonstewart: maven appears to be inscrutable to me.
[2014-02-11 12:36:50] simonstewart: OK.
[2014-02-11 12:36:54] simonstewart: I'll use "google" then :)
[2014-02-11 12:37:10] ddary: :)
[2014-02-11 12:40:34] ddary: with regards to your "build tool change request" i'm personally fine to use it. We should probably also ask lukeis and think about the impact to appium. In the past they have used only the selendroid-server, but currently i'm not sure. I have seen some messages that looked like they are using the standalone server.
[2014-02-11 12:40:43] simonstewart: Oh.
[2014-02-11 12:41:02] simonstewart: I'm not going to push for selendroid to switch to buck until I can get selenium built using it
[2014-02-11 12:41:08] ddary: But from a coupling perspective it would be probably better if they just rely on the maven artifacts.
[2014-02-11 12:41:30] ddary: ok
[2014-02-11 12:41:33] simonstewart: Though it might be nice to move to gradle, because there's always room in my life for another tool
[2014-02-11 12:41:34] simonstewart: :)
[2014-02-11 12:41:38] yashas: I decresed the screen size to 3.7 but still not getting the image in inspector?
[2014-02-11 12:41:57] ddary: and if they need more frequent updates, we can push to the sonatype snapshot repository
[2014-02-11 12:42:44] yashas:  #275 gus have a look at this in git
[2014-02-11 12:42:52] yashas: i have also added snapshot of it
[2014-02-11 12:42:54] ddary: simonstewart: gradle, mhh, i don't know. My preference it then buck
[2014-02-11 12:43:01] simonstewart: Ha!
[2014-02-11 12:43:04] simonstewart: Fair enough :)
[2014-02-11 12:43:20] ddary: yashas: if you run adb logcat
[2014-02-11 12:43:31] yashas: I am really very sorry in interference in betweeen
[2014-02-11 12:43:32] ddary: do you see an error/exception there
[2014-02-11 12:43:34] yashas: and yes
[2014-02-11 12:44:38] yashas: i dont see a error message as such
[2014-02-11 12:47:11] yashas: let me try to restart adb server and adt
[2014-02-11 12:47:34] yashas: from morning trying to fix this issue
[2014-02-11 12:48:23] yashas: Do i have to use firefox or any browser is good to go?

[2014-02-11 12:51:24] ddary: friscodelrosario: where are you based? coz of the stickers...
[2014-02-11 12:52:20] friscodelrosario: San Francisco.
[2014-02-11 12:52:40] ddary: do you know lukeis?
[2014-02-11 12:53:14] ddary: just asking because I sent him 20 stickers
[2014-02-11 12:53:21] friscodelrosario: I do, though we have not met.
[2014-02-11 12:53:33] ddary: and he is based there as well
[2014-02-11 12:53:34] friscodelrosario: I'll ask him for one.
[2014-02-11 12:53:41] ddary: great
[2014-02-11 12:54:22] ddary: so, i guess it will take some more days until they arrive. shipped them last wednesday from Germany
[2014-02-11 12:55:36] yashas: @ddary: Is there a way record and play back functionality in selendroid possible?
[2014-02-11 12:56:11] ddary: :yt selendroid inspector
[2014-02-11 12:56:55] ddary: ^^ there you can see how the very basic recording works. there is no playback planned...
[2014-02-11 12:56:59] ddary: simonstewart: "instrumentation:io.selendroid/io.selendroid.ServerInstrumentation"
[2014-02-11 12:57:23] simonstewart: Right. That's the name I expect to see
[2014-02-11 12:57:31] ddary:                                   ^^ that out put you get by running adb
[2014-02-11 12:57:47] simonstewart: "instrumentation:io.selendroid/.ServerInstrumentation"
[2014-02-11 12:57:51] simonstewart: That's what I get from adb
[2014-02-11 12:59:01] ddary: my assumption is,that because the base package of the selendroid-server is 'io.selendroid' and the ServerInstrumentation class is in that package, you can remove that base package
[2014-02-11 12:59:16] simonstewart: Shame that doesn't work :)
[2014-02-11 12:59:42] ddary: you mean the buck build in general?
[2014-02-11 13:00:23] simonstewart: I mean that when the standalone server installs the selendroid server on the device, the instrumentation package lacks "io.selendroid" prefixed to ".ServerInstrumentation"
[2014-02-11 13:00:47] simonstewart: AbstractDevice appears to be getting the aut base package name correcrly
[2014-02-11 13:03:28] ddary: the AndroidApplication.xml of the selendroid-server will be generated dynamically for the aut: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-standalone/src/main/java/io/selendroid/builder/SelendroidServerBuilder.java?source=c#L138
[2014-02-11 13:04:44] ddary: lunch break, will be back soon
[2014-02-11 13:07:55] yashas: Guys one more thing that is painful to handle , is if emulator closes due to some reasons, the error messages given my selendroid server hog my system to still
