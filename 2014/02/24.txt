[2014-02-24 11:25:48] thu2004: Did you have a chance to review my pull request ?
[2014-02-24 11:25:49] ddary: thanks for the PR, i have seen it
[2014-02-24 11:26:38] ddary: the commiters will soon have a conversation about some technical topics.
[2014-02-24 11:27:27] thu2004: sound good.
[2014-02-24 11:27:36] ddary: i will then bring up the PR and I want to understand first, what is the state of multi touch gestures in the webdriver spec and see, if that is something that can be implemented soon.

[2014-02-24 11:28:43] ddary: if it is there and we can implement it in the right way, i prefer to do that. if it is not clear, how long it will take until we have the spec, i'm fine to accept the PR
[2014-02-24 11:28:53] ddary: does this makes sense to you?
[2014-02-24 11:30:50] thu2004: Yes, I do prefer to do it in the correct way if the webdriver spec is ready in near future.
[2014-02-24 11:32:29] thu2004: Totally agree on your comments.
[2014-02-24 11:35:24] ddary: great and thanks for your understanding!
