[2014-02-24 11:25:24] ddary: hi thu2004
[2014-02-24 11:25:48] thu2004: Did you have a chance to review my pull request ?
[2014-02-24 11:25:49] ddary: thanks for the PR, i have seen it
[2014-02-24 11:26:38] ddary: the commiters will soon have a conversation about some technical topics.
[2014-02-24 11:27:27] thu2004: sound good.
[2014-02-24 11:27:36] ddary: i will then bring up the PR and I want to understand first, what is the state of multi touch gestures in the webdriver spec and see, if that is something that can be implemented soon.

[2014-02-24 11:28:43] ddary: if it is there and we can implement it in the right way, i prefer to do that. if it is not clear, how long it will take until we have the spec, i'm fine to accept the PR
[2014-02-24 11:28:53] ddary: does this makes sense to you?
[2014-02-24 11:30:50] thu2004: Yes, I do prefer to do it in the correct way if the webdriver spec is ready in near future.
[2014-02-24 11:32:29] thu2004: Totally agree on your comments.
[2014-02-24 11:35:24] ddary: great and thanks for your understanding!

[2014-02-24 19:52:05] ddary: hi all
[2014-02-24 19:52:11] lukeis: hi
[2014-02-24 19:52:50] ddary: are the selenium artifacts for 2.40 available somewhere?
[2014-02-24 19:55:31] lukeis: in maven? :)
[2014-02-24 19:55:40] lukeis: and do you want the standalone server?
[2014-02-24 19:56:14] lukeis: http://ci.seleniumhq.org/selenium-server-4c5c0568b004f67810ee41c459549aa4b09c651e.jar
[2014-02-24 19:56:55] lukeis: I have the next two days to physically hold simonstewart by the neck to get the downloads thing fully resolved ;)
[2014-02-24 19:57:28] lukeis: ddary: did you send simon selendroid stickers? (wondering who I need to give some to :) )
[2014-02-24 19:58:07] ddary: lukeis: i have sent simonstewart stickers,  but have not yet heard back from him if they arrived
[2014-02-24 19:58:33] lukeis: ok ;) then I will not be giving one to him! :-D
[2014-02-24 19:58:39] ddary: :D
[2014-02-24 19:59:14] ddary: so basically from the 100 i have ordered I have 10 left, so the next order has been already made
[2014-02-24 20:01:19] ddary: lukeis: we had all the time issues entering some special characters. it turned out that there is no easy way to solve the issue. What I now have done is to implement a handling where you can configure nativeEvents true/false for certain commands and with that, you are then able e.g. to enter japanese characters
[2014-02-24 20:02:09] lukeis: ahh, cool, i have a local native events implementation that I was testing out, but can likely discard now ;)
[2014-02-24 20:03:06] ddary: you can have a look and improve my version
[2014-02-24 20:03:10] ddary: :D
