[2014-02-19 08:53:08] bhans1: hello
[2014-02-19 08:57:13] ddary: I'm wondering why the people have to much issues not finding the aapt program
[2014-02-19 09:36:00] ddary: :snapshot
[2014-02-19 10:03:39] bhans1: maybe they didn't configure their environment variables clearly?
[2014-02-19 10:53:56] ddary: bhans1: maybe, or not start the android application and download all the needed files

[2014-02-19 13:40:05] smiklosovic: ddary: hey, would you have few minutes please?
[2014-02-19 13:40:11] ddary: sure
[2014-02-19 13:41:19] smiklosovic: great
[2014-02-19 13:41:24] smiklosovic: i am doing some testing
[2014-02-19 13:41:29] smiklosovic: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=eJjm0MPr
[2014-02-19 13:41:51] smiklosovic: problem is that when i do "this.username.sendKeys(username);"
[2014-02-19 13:42:02] smiklosovic: virtual keyboard appears on a screen
[2014-02-19 13:42:27] smiklosovic: without invoking "driver.getKeyboard().sendKeys(SelendroidKeys.BACK);" after it, that exception occurs
[2014-02-19 13:43:02] smiklosovic: however when i hide that keyboard it proceeds and fails when I try to write something to email field
[2014-02-19 13:43:22] smiklosovic: i set permissions as INJECT_EVENTS into manifest so that is not a problem i guess
[2014-02-19 13:43:39] smiklosovic: do i have to hide keyboard manually every time?
[2014-02-19 13:43:48] smiklosovic: not sure if it is bug of feature
[2014-02-19 13:43:51] ddary: ha, that is interesting
[2014-02-19 13:44:04] ddary: well,
[2014-02-19 13:44:13] ddary: that is the next good questions
[2014-02-19 13:44:38] ddary: just that I understood you correctly
[2014-02-19 13:45:50] ddary: when you hide the keyboard you can click the element,
[2014-02-19 13:46:02] ddary: when the text field is there, you get the exception
[2014-02-19 13:46:08] smiklosovic: yes, when i do not hide it, keyboard covers that field
[2014-02-19 13:46:10] ddary: or do you get the exception all the time
[2014-02-19 13:47:09] smiklosovic: 1. I click to username field 2. keyboard appears 3. i write keys to it 4. i want to click to email field but keyboard covers it 5. exception occurs
[2014-02-19 13:47:17] ddary: can you please double check the latest selendrioid-server? directly from the github page please, because there we changed something to the visibility of elements
[2014-02-19 13:48:05] smiklosovic: 1. i click to username field, 2. keyboard appears 3. i write keys to username 4. -> I hide keyboard <- 5. i click to email field and send keys 6. exception does not occur
[2014-02-19 13:48:06] ddary: yeah, that was the next question. why do you click in the text field? that is simething that selendroid should do automatically
[2014-02-19 13:48:48] smiklosovic: aha
[2014-02-19 13:48:50] smiklosovic: hmm
[2014-02-19 13:49:08] smiklosovic: didnt know that, maybe just to somehow grab a focus
[2014-02-19 13:49:25] ddary: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-server/src/main/java/io/selendroid/server/model/AndroidNativeElement.java#L161
[2014-02-19 13:49:42] ddary: should work out of the box
[2014-02-19 13:50:20] smiklosovic: i try without clicking and when it fails i grab the latest version
[2014-02-19 13:51:04] ddary: the way how events are send to the app has changed. this allows us to identify app crashes but seems at least sometimes requires to have this inject events permission
[2014-02-19 13:51:23] smiklosovic: yeah i have it in that aut
[2014-02-19 13:51:44] ddary: we thought about it and will probably add something like try the new and better way and then, if it fails, use the old way
[2014-02-19 13:54:36] ddary: AutomatedTester: is there a way (protocol endpoint) that can and should be used to terminate the whole driver instance process?
[2014-02-19 13:58:21] smiklosovic: ddary: it works without clicking, thanks, i would never figure it out on my own
[2014-02-19 14:00:16] ddary: have you tried the new server? would be great if that works better. the issue we work on was: https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/issues/268
[2014-02-19 14:06:50] jlipps, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-02-19 14:08:14] smiklosovic: i just used 0.8.0 release
[2014-02-19 14:22:27] jlipps, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-02-19 14:25:53] ddary: yeah, the bug has been implemented after the release
[2014-02-19 14:26:46] smiklosovic: aha
[2014-02-19 14:27:03] AutomatedTester: ddary: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId
[2014-02-19 14:27:08] AutomatedTester: the DELETE command
[2014-02-19 14:27:36] ddary: AutomatedTester: but that is only to kill the sessio.
[2014-02-19 14:27:39] ddary: n
[2014-02-19 14:28:06] ddary: that mean, killing the driver itself it not supported.
[2014-02-19 14:28:13] AutomatedTester: no
[2014-02-19 14:28:34] AutomatedTester: since its done in different ways by different drivers
[2014-02-19 14:28:36] ddary: I don't need that "feature", it is a customer who is asking for it
[2014-02-19 14:29:20] ddary: he has implemented his own endpoint and is calling system.exit(0)
[2014-02-19 14:29:59] ddary: how can the firefox driver be stopped completely?
[2014-02-19 14:30:17] AutomatedTester: when you call quit() we delete the session and terminate the process
[2014-02-19 14:35:07] ddary: AutomatedTester: ok
[2014-02-19 14:43:56] ddary: smiklosovic: do you have any number on how many people are using droidium?
[2014-02-19 15:07:07] ddary: :seen lukeis
[2014-02-19 15:08:23] smiklosovic: ddary: i dont
[2014-02-19 15:08:55] smiklosovic: ddary: we are using it internally heavilly
[2014-02-19 15:09:07] ddary: good to know
[2014-02-19 15:09:20] smiklosovic: ddary: plus i do not think that number of "stars" in gh is good number
[2014-02-19 15:09:32] ddary: very true
[2014-02-19 15:09:57] smiklosovic: but i think that number will not be high at all, lets be realistic :)
[2014-02-19 15:09:57] ddary: users on the documentation pages / download numbers is better, but still
[2014-02-19 15:10:18] smiklosovic: selendroid is a leader here
[2014-02-19 15:11:19] smiklosovic: i was on few conferences with it but unless we have at least first final release serious propagation is out of scope
[2014-02-19 15:16:48] smiklosovic: right now we want to drop deprecated android server from selenium and align with selendroid's android-driver.apk and some other issues are blocking us like releases of other tooling on which droidium depends
[2014-02-19 15:22:03] ddary: k

[2014-02-19 17:19:50] lukeis: spent last night in carmel (my wedding anniversary)
[2014-02-19 17:20:07] lukeis: yes, but haven't put much thought into it :)
[2014-02-19 17:20:10] ddary: congrats
[2014-02-19 17:20:22] ddary: no problem

[2014-02-19 17:21:03] ddary: just wanted to wait for you and then reply to simon and suggest a time for the hangout
[2014-02-19 17:22:02] lukeis: feel free to suggest a time :) tonight I'll be heading to mountain view to watch simonstewart give a speech
[2014-02-19 17:29:34] simonstewart: hang on. What speech?
