[2014-02-12 13:20:53] ddary: i was not able to get it run on my devices/emulators, that was the reason why i have not used the framebuffer method

[2014-02-12 15:06:13] ddary: ti?
[2014-02-12 15:07:16] simonstewart: it
[2014-02-12 15:08:43] ddary: the weird thing is, that when I used nativedriver over 2 years ago, it was working fine.
