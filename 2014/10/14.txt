[2014-10-14 21:08:52] lukeis: what do you see happening? anything? nothing? is there something in the logcat?
[2014-10-14 21:09:10] rkokkula: I did put the logcat trace in the github issue
[2014-10-14 21:09:50] rkokkula: I tried forceReinstall, manually uninstall and reinstalling app all these but still see this error
[2014-10-14 21:10:05] rkokkula: I have been waiting for any clues can you please help me out
[2014-10-14 21:10:35] lukeis: are you two different users in github? cause I don't see your output
[2014-10-14 21:10:54] rkokkula: no this is Rajani here
[2014-10-14 21:11:21] lukeis: you only put the java stacktrace
[2014-10-14 21:11:31] lukeis: you need to run `adb logcat`
