[2014-11-18 20:39:01] Mr_Nice_: do you guys know if there is an assembly for selendroid available for visual studio? I have installed android sdk and run selendroid.  It all seems to be working, I am just having difficulty creating the calling C# code in visual studio.  I feel like I am missing a library

[2014-11-18 21:07:39] lukeis: Mr_Nice_: do you have the Selenium .NET bindings?
[2014-11-18 21:07:48] lukeis: (library)
[2014-11-18 21:08:56] ddary: hi lukeis :-)
[2014-11-18 21:09:06] lukeis: hi ddary
[2014-11-18 21:09:16] ddary: how are you doing?
[2014-11-18 21:09:33] lukeis: pretty good :) too involved in iOS the past few months
[2014-11-18 21:10:01] lukeis: what happens i suppose when the iOS guy on your team is no longer on your team ;)
[2014-11-18 21:10:56] ddary: and do you use ios-driver or appium?

[2014-11-18 21:17:41] lukeis: ddary: both :)
[2014-11-18 21:17:59] ddary: :-)
[2014-11-18 21:18:31] lukeis: but we're seemingly only going to be using appium in the futureâ€¦ we couldn't get ios-driver to work on ios8 in saucelabs
[2014-11-18 21:18:52] lukeis: got ios-driver running locallyâ€¦ just not in sauce labs :(
[2014-11-18 21:19:09] lukeis: so. many. timing. issues.
[2014-11-18 21:23:43] ddary: sad to hear that
[2014-11-18 21:24:04] ddary: have you talked with francois, did he had an idea?
[2014-11-18 21:24:51] lukeis: wasn't really able to sync up with himâ€¦ he also had his own branch that ran ios8, but it was significantly bit-rotted from the dev branch
[2014-11-18 21:25:21] ddary: ok
[2014-11-18 21:25:28] lukeis: even with his changes, only in sauce labs I had issues with connecting to the WebView over the RWKDP
[2014-11-18 21:25:54] lukeis: tore my hair out for a while on that ;)
[2014-11-18 21:26:26] ddary: if (iosdriver==true) exit with timing issues;
[2014-11-18 21:26:32] lukeis: heh
[2014-11-18 21:26:38] ddary: ^^just remove that line ;-)
[2014-11-18 21:26:45] lukeis: i wish :)
[2014-11-18 21:28:52] lukeis: soâ€¦ right now we have tests running on iOS7 w/ ios-driver and iOS8 w/ appium
[2014-11-18 21:30:00] ddary: and are the tests relatively similiar or different?
[2014-11-18 21:30:37] lukeis: the tests? we have a few thousand ;)
[2014-11-18 21:30:59] ddary: wow
[2014-11-18 21:31:37] lukeis: what happens when you are able to reuse tests because the "functionality" is the same on desktop and mobile :)
[2014-11-18 21:31:48] lukeis: page objects FTW
[2014-11-18 21:32:19] ddary: sounds good :-)
[2014-11-18 21:32:34] lukeis: and not only mobile safari, but also our hybrid app
[2014-11-18 21:32:53] lukeis: was nice getting that all running ;)
[2014-11-18 21:35:11] Mr_Nice_: @lukeis I have installed selenium & support package from nuget.  I couldnt find any nuget for selendroid
[2014-11-18 21:35:37] lukeis: there isn't one...
[2014-11-18 21:36:15] Mr_Nice_: is there a dll or something?
[2014-11-18 21:36:55] lukeis: just the selenium packageâ€¦ and then you'll need to use the RemoteWebDriver
[2014-11-18 21:37:13] lukeis: and you'll have to start up the selendroid-standalone server separately
[2014-11-18 21:37:18] Mr_Nice_: ahhh
[2014-11-18 21:37:57] Mr_Nice_: i saw a code snippet on a blog and there was stuff like "new SelendroidBrowser()" so it threw me
[2014-11-18 21:38:21] Mr_Nice_: thanks, ill have a go with remoteWebDriver

[2014-11-18 22:34:38] Mr_Nice_: Hi Again.  I am getting "io.selendroid.exceptions.SessionNotCreatedException: Error starting Selendroid session" when trying to use remote driver.  Any tips on how to start debugging this?
[2014-11-18 22:56:17] Mr_Nice_: I made a SO question if anyone is intrested to look: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27004780/io-selendroid-exceptions-sessionnotcreatedexception-error-starting-selendroid-s
[2014-11-18 23:00:06] lukeis: Mr_Nice_: there's gotta be more tot he trace than thatâ€¦ maybe something in the standalone server output or maybe in the `adb logcat` ?
[2014-11-18 23:00:42] Mr_Nice_: Where can I see the SA server log?
[2014-11-18 23:01:10] lukeis: log? in the console where you're running it?
[2014-11-18 23:01:51] Mr_Nice_: lol, sorry, I forgot about console.
[2014-11-18 23:02:25] Mr_Nice_: yeah I got much longer error message here
[2014-11-18 23:02:46] Mr_Nice_: one part says device not found
[2014-11-18 23:03:21] lukeis: yeah, it can't find any devices, you may need to create an avd
[2014-11-18 23:03:27] lukeis: `android avd`
[2014-11-18 23:03:33] Mr_Nice_: I created an AVD and its running
[2014-11-18 23:03:43] Mr_Nice_: do i need to `hook it up` somehow?
[2014-11-18 23:03:46] lukeis: if you run adb devices does it show up?
[2014-11-18 23:04:13] lukeis: selendroid *should* detect the running emulator
[2014-11-18 23:04:31] lukeis: of course you are on windows ;)  all bets are lost ;)
[2014-11-18 23:04:40] Mr_Nice_: is 'adb devices' a command switch?
[2014-11-18 23:04:48] lukeis: yes
[2014-11-18 23:04:57] Mr_Nice_: ok trying now
[2014-11-18 23:04:59] lukeis: adb is in the android-sdk
[2014-11-18 23:05:26] Mr_Nice_: ahh, im using the GUI
[2014-11-18 23:05:48] lukeis: GUI? what's that? ;)  j/k
[2014-11-18 23:05:54] Mr_Nice_: hehe
[2014-11-18 23:07:14] Mr_Nice_: im not even sure how to run android sdk from console, but i can see the device running in AVD manager
[2014-11-18 23:08:03] Mr_Nice_: command prompt doesnt recognise 'android' as a command
[2014-11-18 23:09:52] lukeis: because android is in the sdk, likely not on your PATH
[2014-11-18 23:14:27] Mr_Nice_: hmm, your right, adb devices shows 0 attached devices
[2014-11-18 23:15:11] Mr_Nice_: i guess I missed some step to register it or something?
[2014-11-18 23:16:16] lukeis: noâ€¦ this is just androidâ€¦ ;)
[2014-11-18 23:16:42] lukeis: try restarting the adb serverâ€¦. `adb kill-server`
[2014-11-18 23:18:22] Mr_Nice_: still not recognisingit, ill try creating an AVD from command line instead of GUI and see if that does it
[2014-11-18 23:19:16] lukeis: you can also try starting the emulator from the command line insteadâ€¦.. emulator -avd <avdname>
[2014-11-18 23:23:29] Mr_Nice_: ahh, seems it doesnt like that I selected 64 bit processor
[2014-11-18 23:24:25] Mr_Nice_: doesnt like x86 either
[2014-11-18 23:26:11] Mr_Nice_: looks like my code it running :)
[2014-11-18 23:26:20] Mr_Nice_: I just needed to change to to arm processor
[2014-11-18 23:28:15] Mr_Nice_: InvalidOperationException now and a timeout exception first.  I think i need to code a wait while the device loads maybe
[2014-11-18 23:29:18] Mr_Nice_: I got a windows with "android" fading in and out, is that the loading screen?
[2014-11-18 23:30:12] Mr_Nice_: aha! yes it was, took longer than I expected to load
[2014-11-18 23:36:36] Mr_Nice_: gonna have a play with the logic in my code.  Thanks for the help Lukeis
