[2014-11-18 20:36:52] Mr_Nice_: hi
[2014-11-18 20:39:01] Mr_Nice_: do you guys know if there is an assembly for selendroid available for visual studio? I have installed android sdk and run selendroid.  It all seems to be working, I am just having difficulty creating the calling C# code in visual studio.  I feel like I am missing a library

[2014-11-18 21:07:39] lukeis: Mr_Nice_: do you have the Selenium .NET bindings?
[2014-11-18 21:07:48] lukeis: (library)
[2014-11-18 21:08:56] ddary: hi lukeis :-)
[2014-11-18 21:09:06] lukeis: hi ddary
[2014-11-18 21:09:16] ddary: how are you doing?
[2014-11-18 21:09:33] lukeis: pretty good :) too involved in iOS the past few months
[2014-11-18 21:10:01] lukeis: what happens i suppose when the iOS guy on your team is no longer on your team ;)
[2014-11-18 21:10:56] ddary: and do you use ios-driver or appium?

[2014-11-18 21:17:41] lukeis: ddary: both :)
[2014-11-18 21:17:59] ddary: :-)
[2014-11-18 21:18:31] lukeis: but we're seemingly only going to be using appium in the futureâ€¦ we couldn't get ios-driver to work on ios8 in saucelabs
[2014-11-18 21:18:52] lukeis: got ios-driver running locallyâ€¦ just not in sauce labs :(
[2014-11-18 21:19:09] lukeis: so. many. timing. issues.
[2014-11-18 21:23:43] ddary: sad to hear that
[2014-11-18 21:24:04] ddary: have you talked with francois, did he had an idea?
[2014-11-18 21:24:51] lukeis: wasn't really able to sync up with himâ€¦ he also had his own branch that ran ios8, but it was significantly bit-rotted from the dev branch
[2014-11-18 21:25:21] ddary: ok
[2014-11-18 21:25:28] lukeis: even with his changes, only in sauce labs I had issues with connecting to the WebView over the RWKDP
[2014-11-18 21:25:54] lukeis: tore my hair out for a while on that ;)
[2014-11-18 21:26:26] ddary: if (iosdriver==true) exit with timing issues;
[2014-11-18 21:26:32] lukeis: heh
[2014-11-18 21:26:38] ddary: ^^just remove that line ;-)
[2014-11-18 21:26:45] lukeis: i wish :)
[2014-11-18 21:28:52] lukeis: soâ€¦ right now we have tests running on iOS7 w/ ios-driver and iOS8 w/ appium
[2014-11-18 21:30:00] ddary: and are the tests relatively similiar or different?
[2014-11-18 21:30:37] lukeis: the tests? we have a few thousand ;)
[2014-11-18 21:30:59] ddary: wow
[2014-11-18 21:31:37] lukeis: what happens when you are able to reuse tests because the "functionality" is the same on desktop and mobile :)
[2014-11-18 21:31:48] lukeis: page objects FTW
[2014-11-18 21:32:19] ddary: sounds good :-)
[2014-11-18 21:32:34] lukeis: and not only mobile safari, but also our hybrid app
[2014-11-18 21:32:53] lukeis: was nice getting that all running ;)
[2014-11-18 21:35:11] Mr_Nice_: @lukeis I have installed selenium & support package from nuget.  I couldnt find any nuget for selendroid
[2014-11-18 21:35:37] lukeis: there isn't one...
[2014-11-18 21:36:15] Mr_Nice_: is there a dll or something?
[2014-11-18 21:36:55] lukeis: just the selenium packageâ€¦ and then you'll need to use the RemoteWebDriver
[2014-11-18 21:37:13] lukeis: and you'll have to start up the selendroid-standalone server separately
[2014-11-18 21:37:18] Mr_Nice_: ahhh
[2014-11-18 21:37:57] Mr_Nice_: i saw a code snippet on a blog and there was stuff like "new SelendroidBrowser()" so it threw me
[2014-11-18 21:38:21] Mr_Nice_: thanks, ill have a go with remoteWebDriver
[2014-11-18 21:39:04] Mr_Nice_, quitting. ()
