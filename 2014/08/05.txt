[2014-08-05 00:24:49] jlipps, joining. (#selendroid)
[2014-08-05 00:35:32] jlipps: ohai lukeis :-)
[2014-08-05 00:35:43] jlipps: i'm running our selendroid tests on 0.11 and our /element/clear test is now failing
[2014-08-05 00:36:00] jlipps: any known issues on your end?
[2014-08-05 00:36:20] lukeis: not known :)
[2014-08-05 00:36:27] lukeis: but i think that changed recently
[2014-08-05 00:36:56] lukeis: or was logged? … i don't know :)
[2014-08-05 00:37:21] jlipps: lukeis:  this is the error i get:
[2014-08-05 00:37:22] jlipps: I/SELENDROID( 4969): io.selendroid.server.handler.ClearElement#handle:35 - Clear element command

[2014-08-05 00:37:43] jlipps: i get that even if i click on the element successfully
[2014-08-05 00:37:44] lukeis: well that's interesting
[2014-08-05 00:37:46] jlipps: and even if i retry 20 times
[2014-08-05 00:37:57] lukeis: this a web view element or native?
[2014-08-05 00:38:02] jlipps: webview
[2014-08-05 00:38:23] jlipps: at least, i got the element with elementById('name_input')
[2014-08-05 00:38:36] lukeis: well that doesn't say anything ;)
[2014-08-05 00:39:11] lukeis: but the trace says web… since it's trying to use an atom
[2014-08-05 00:39:25] lukeis: i don't think the atoms have been updated though...
[2014-08-05 00:39:55] jlipps: very odd. let me back down to 0.10 and make sure this doesn't repro there.
[2014-08-05 00:40:01] jlipps: 0.10 was the last version we used, which i know is quite old
[2014-08-05 00:47:30] lukeis: jlipps: so what's even more odd is that the atom's haven't changed between 0.10 and 0.11 (at least we didn't import any new ones from the Selenium project). are you using the same device / api level you did before? :) (if you can remember)
[2014-08-05 00:48:02] jlipps: lukeis:  stand by, running tests with same config with 0.10
[2014-08-05 00:49:08] jlipps: lukeis:  ok weird, that failed too
[2014-08-05 00:49:12] jlipps: maybe something in my setup changed
[2014-08-05 01:33:14] jlipps: lukeis:  it works in 4.3, not in 4.4
[2014-08-05 01:33:26] jlipps: that's what the issue is
[2014-08-05 01:33:30] jlipps: no clue why it doesn't work in 4.4
[2014-08-05 01:33:52] lukeis: chrome vs. default browser webview
[2014-08-05 01:35:41] smccarthy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2014-08-05 01:45:17] jlipps: lukeis:  is selendroid supposed to work with the chrome-backed webview?
[2014-08-05 01:52:32] lukeis: should… and tested are two different things :)
[2014-08-05 01:52:44] lukeis: jlipps: it is supposed to
[2014-08-05 01:54:06] jlipps: lukeis:  ok. in that case i humbly recommend that you guys test webview-based clear() with api level 19
[2014-08-05 01:54:18] lukeis: :)
[2014-08-05 01:54:49] lukeis: jlipps: i should say i have the intention of having selendroid switch to chromedriver for web view in api 19+
