[2016-01-12 18:04:51] athicarl: thanks for your help yesterday...i made some progress
[2016-01-12 18:05:02] athicarl: but now I am stuck somewhere else
[2016-01-12 18:05:10] athicarl: would you be able to help please?

[2016-01-12 18:09:55] lukeis: hi athicarl, the exception shown is quite odd! :)  Can you also run `adb logcat` and gist that too? I'm hoping there's a stacktrace in there that would shed some light on why there seems to be an infinite loop in the json response data
[2016-01-12 18:11:18] athicarl: sure I could do that
[2016-01-12 18:11:24] athicarl: give me 2 mins
[2016-01-12 18:15:27] athicarl: here it is:-
[2016-01-12 18:15:28] athicarl: https://gist.github.com/aprashanthsai/f345b914867cd0ee0f96
[2016-01-12 18:18:03] lukeis: well, that didn't show anything :-/    did you try to run your test while you had the logcat open? (if not, can you?)
[2016-01-12 18:21:32] athicarl: I did...the logs from starting of test execution till the time it fails with the error
[2016-01-12 18:21:54] athicarl: The app & selendroid server is installed on the device
[2016-01-12 18:22:18] athicarl: & the main activity (LoginActivity) is started as well
[2016-01-12 18:22:33] athicarl: which shows up on the screen....and then the error shows up
