[2015-06-30 00:25:05] lukeis: so, now on API 18â€¦ only 3 tests failed  TouchScrollTest.testCanScrollVertically  TouchScrollTest.testCanScrollVerticallyFromWebElement  and PageSourceTest.shouldGetNativePageSourceAsXML
[2015-06-30 00:25:22] lukeis: these e2e tests need a lot of work ;)
[2015-06-30 00:35:41] asm89: lukeis: flaky tests I'm guessing
[2015-06-30 00:35:44] asm89: retry running just those
[2015-06-30 00:36:10] asm89: mvn -Dtest=TouchScrollTest
[2015-06-30 00:36:12] asm89: etc
[2015-06-30 00:36:14] asm89: < out for now!
[2015-06-30 00:36:18] lukeis: :)
[2015-06-30 00:36:41] lukeis: i don't want to just retry an individual test! ;) what's this "flakey" crap?!
