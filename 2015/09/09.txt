[2015-09-09 00:53:09] renee_: @AutomatedTester and @smccarthy: Am doing a config.setforceReinstall(true) in my code but if one of my test fails, when the app is launched to run the second test, the app relaunches from the same page where the test failed the first time. So, forceReinstall() is not working. I did do a print config.isForceReinstall() -- that does return a "true" but the application isn't actually reinstalled. Any thoughts on how to fix this issue??
