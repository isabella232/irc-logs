[2015-09-03 18:09:45] Guest11971: Hey is it possible to use the "-folder" Selendroid-Standalone command line parameters when im starting the server programmatically?
[2015-09-03 18:10:11] Guest11971: So if will load the latest APk for me
[2015-09-03 18:10:19] Guest11971: it*
[2015-09-03 18:11:19] lukeis: apparently notâ€¦ a public setter isn't exposed on SelendroidConfigurationâ€¦ but it should be
[2015-09-03 18:12:05] Guest11971: ok thanks, was afraid of that
[2015-09-03 18:13:16] Guest11971: if its not to hard to fix is it possible to request that somehow?
[2015-09-03 18:13:37] lukeis: done ;)
