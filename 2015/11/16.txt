[2015-11-16 19:49:55] ddary: hi lukeis
[2015-11-16 19:50:05] lukeis: hi
[2015-11-16 19:50:13] ddary: do you have an idea why the build ^^ is failing?
[2015-11-16 19:50:32] lukeis: pinging the guys who made the PR on slack about it...
[2015-11-16 19:50:51] lukeis: definitely a gradle issue ;)
[2015-11-16 19:50:55] ddary: when i executed the build some days back on my work machine, everything was good
[2015-11-16 19:51:02] ddary: :-)
[2015-11-16 19:51:06] lukeis: yep, not sure what's up here...
