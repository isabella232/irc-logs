[2015-03-11 16:50:48] operatiay: I won't push them directly though... too risky

[2015-03-11 16:55:02] lukeis: at work, i typically get at least 2 choice comments on every code review
[2015-03-11 16:55:49] operatiay: meaning?
[2015-03-11 16:55:51] lukeis: outside perspective helps take a step back and question what the fuck you're doing ;)
[2015-03-11 16:56:09] lukeis: meaning i'm always learning too :)
[2015-03-11 16:56:23] operatiay: yes, you might reconsider the whole commit and the reasoning behind
[2015-03-11 16:57:07] operatiay: :) if the commenter feels confident enough to make such a comment
[2015-03-11 16:58:05] lukeis: feelings in code review are pointlessâ€¦ everyone should say just about anything they think as long as it's a legitimate pointâ€¦ (saying shit like 'this sucks' or 'this is bad' doesn't help anyone)
[2015-03-11 17:00:03] lukeis: but on the flip side, nit-picking a code review because it's not exactly how you would do it, is not helpful either :)
[2015-03-11 17:00:15] operatiay: legitimacy is what I might not be able to judge
[2015-03-11 17:00:40] lukeis: not all code review comments are actionable :)
[2015-03-11 17:00:54] operatiay: :) if you feel that you're not the only one who would do it differently...
[2015-03-11 17:01:45] operatiay: :) true, but not all commits are mergeable as well...
[2015-03-11 17:03:02] lukeis: basically i think there's no reason for someone to be shy in a code review, either way someone will learn something by asking questions
[2015-03-11 17:03:10] operatiay: by the way, I've tried your suggestion to debug the server on device... I've changed the package name to the app's name... this lead to it not being installable (it wanted to override the app)
[2015-03-11 17:03:41] lukeis: oh, you need to change the package name to be that of what selendroid would have changed itself to be
[2015-03-11 17:03:49] operatiay: agree, I need to work on my comment shyness
[2015-03-11 17:03:54] lukeis: like:  io.selendroid.com.yourcompany.yourapp
[2015-03-11 17:04:28] smccarthy, joining. (#selendroid)
[2015-03-11 17:04:41] operatiay: :) ah, ok, that makes more sense... but then the server has already been deployed under this package name... is it not debuggable?
[2015-03-11 17:05:09] lukeis: not sure if your IDE will attach to it, usually you have to 'run' in debug mode from the IDE
[2015-03-11 17:05:36] operatiay: I was not able to see it running from IDE as a process... :(
[2015-03-11 17:06:09] operatiay: only if it's displayed as a process can IDE debug it... based on my little experience with Android development
[2015-03-11 17:06:12] lukeis: not sure exactly how to kick of the instrumentation in debug mode though :-/  hmmm, might need to 'run a test' to do it
[2015-03-11 17:07:00] lukeis: if i have a day to kill, i'll try it out and write up a wiki on it
[2015-03-11 17:07:04] operatiay: :) would be nice to have it documented somewhere... someone else might want to debug the server
[2015-03-11 17:07:11] lukeis: indeed!
[2015-03-11 17:07:19] operatiay: !m lukeis

[2015-03-11 17:07:52] operatiay: where's dominik? :) are you hiding him?
[2015-03-11 17:08:26] lukeis: i think i last saw him mention him going to a conferenceâ€¦ but also he doesn't do irc while at work anymore
[2015-03-11 17:08:50] operatiay: he's a busy man now :)
[2015-03-11 17:08:54] lukeis: he's a pointy-hair now, all his contributions are purely on the side :)

[2015-03-11 17:13:52] lukeis: we have svp's and directors and such for that
[2015-03-11 17:13:55] lukeis: no :)
[2015-03-11 17:14:00] lukeis: i'm just a "lead" :)
[2015-03-11 17:14:25] operatiay: :) how many more years till principle?
[2015-03-11 17:14:31] lukeis:  Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[2015-03-11 17:14:53] lukeis: i don't necessarily think these titles should have anything to do with years-in-service
[2015-03-11 17:15:12] lukeis: i'd actually be quite happy to stay exactly where I am until i retire
[2015-03-11 17:15:12] operatiay: but they do have something in common with salary
[2015-03-11 17:15:36] lukeis: somewhatâ€¦ i think i get paid more than some principles and architects though :)
[2015-03-11 17:15:59] operatiay: :) that's nice, so you'll get even more when you become one of those
[2015-03-11 17:16:34] lukeis: eh, it's usually a marginal increase for titleâ€¦ annual merit increases do me just fine
