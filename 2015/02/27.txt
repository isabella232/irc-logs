[2015-02-27 15:04:45] wiwe: Is it possible for me to use adb commands before running the selendroid session. Im basically using the demo project. I would like to use an adb command "adb uninstall com.package,project" and after that i would like that selendroid installs the app

[2015-02-27 17:51:57] NguyenA1: has anyone ran into this?  So I'm trying to run a end to end test to test my changes.  I chose to run io.selendroid.tests.SayHelloWebviewTest from the selendroid-test-app project
[2015-02-27 17:52:07] NguyenA1: after emulator comes up and app gets installed i get this exception
[2015-02-27 17:52:28] NguyenA1: io.selendroid.server.common.exceptions.SelendroidException: Could not start the app under test using instrumentation. Is the correct app under test installed? Read the details below: INSTRUMENTATION_STATUS: id=ActivityManagerService INSTRUMENTATION_STATUS: Error=Unable to find instrumentation target package: io.selendroid.testapp INSTRUMENTATION_STATUS_CODE: -1 android.util.AndroidException: INSTRUMENTATION_FAILED: io.selendroi
[2015-02-27 17:52:37] ddary, joining. (#selendroid)
[2015-02-27 17:53:29] NguyenA1: its weird because i can see the app installed when it does
[2015-02-27 17:53:29] NguyenA1: adb -s emulator-5560 shell pm list packages io.selendroid.testapp
[2015-02-27 17:55:46] NguyenA1: most things on the web talk about modifying an android manifest.xml file in the app, but this app has already been built and is included in the seldnroid-test-app project
[2015-02-27 18:02:25] ddary: :log
[2015-02-27 18:05:01] ddary: :note wiwe if you start the selendroid-standalone you can use the parameter â€”forceReinstall : https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/blob/master/selendroid-standalone/src/main/java/io/selendroid/standalone/SelendroidConfiguration.java#L115
[2015-02-27 18:06:54] smccarthy, quitting. (Quit: Leaving...)
[2015-02-27 18:09:55] NguyenA1: so from working within eclipse, do you suggest that 1.  i first start selendroid-standalone as a java application, then run SayHelloWebviewTest?  because i originally did this and it complained about port already in use
[2015-02-27 18:10:29] NguyenA1: so then if i do option 2, which is just run SayHelloWebviewTest, i notice the client code is smart enough that if selendroid-standalone isn't running, it starts up selendroid
[2015-02-27 18:11:40] NguyenA1: sorry, not client code doing that, it is the test case that does that in the before class with launcher.launchSelendroid()
[2015-02-27 18:15:20] NguyenA1: okay i added that config and now I'm getting Missing APK file exception on device.install(app);
[2015-02-27 18:15:30] NguyenA1: ill tinker around with this now, thanks dominick
[2015-02-27 18:16:33] ddary: @NguyenA1 hello and are you using the right path to your apk?
[2015-02-27 18:17:38] NguyenA1: i'm just running the sample test SayHelloWebviewTest already included with selendroid, i haven't analyzed what app it is installing or where it is coming from
[2015-02-27 18:17:48] NguyenA1: from eclipse with run as junit
[2015-02-27 18:26:55] NguyenA1: so going with option 2 from above where i just run SayHelloWebviewTest, i'm not understanding how the apk is installed
[2015-02-27 18:27:06] NguyenA1: i see a new instanced of InstalledAndroidApp is created for the app
[2015-02-27 18:27:39] NguyenA1: later on the command line object is created with CommandLine command = adbCommand("install", "-r", app.getAbsolutePath());
[2015-02-27 18:27:53] NguyenA1: but, InstalledAndroidApp returns null for getAbsolutePath()

[2015-02-27 22:56:28] JimBean: Question: When I run arc I see a function "driver.wait."  However, when I run cucumber/ruby I can't see the wait function under the $driver object.  I am using the code from this page: https://github.com/appium/sample-code/blob/ff1f24f48b2574a22687353d98ae16964eb36e25/sample-code/examples/ruby/cucumber_ios/features/support/env.rb.  When I do pry on ls $device I can see the object but no wait function
[2015-02-27 23:00:34] JimBean: From within pry it looks like $device is very limited while under arc device is contains a lot of methods.  Perhaps I am looking at two different objects that happen to be called the same.  Any thoughts would be helpful.
