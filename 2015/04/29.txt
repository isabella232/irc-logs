[2015-04-29 20:12:15] ddary: hi lukeis, had you looked at https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/pull/860 ?
[2015-04-29 20:12:58] lukeis: not really
[2015-04-29 20:13:28] lukeis: this is from the austin texas (UT) students :)
[2015-04-29 20:13:52] lukeis: i'll try to look...
[2015-04-29 20:15:27] ddary: ok
[2015-04-29 20:15:46] ddary: it looked like it is a PR from Texas
[2015-04-29 20:16:54] lukeis: hmmm, i think there may be some logic errorsâ€¦ or at least not a correct interpretation of the multi-action spec
[2015-04-29 20:19:09] ddary: ok, can you respond to them?
[2015-04-29 20:19:28] lukeis: yeah, i willâ€¦ need to provide some detail though
[2015-04-29 20:20:35] ddary: ok, thanks
