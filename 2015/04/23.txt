[2015-04-23 09:52:37] ddary: hi smikloso
[2015-04-23 09:59:28] ddary: hi s_enya
[2015-04-23 09:59:43] ddary: you had a question about building selendroid, right?
[2015-04-23 10:39:37] smikloso: ddary: hello
[2015-04-23 10:39:52] ddary: how are you doing?
[2015-04-23 10:40:03] smikloso: ddary: i am good, thanks!
[2015-04-23 10:40:07] smikloso: ddary: what about you?
[2015-04-23 10:40:17] ddary: doing good as well
[2015-04-23 10:42:31] ddary: you are still working at red hat, right?
[2015-04-23 10:44:01] smikloso: ddary: yes
[2015-04-23 10:44:23] ddary: and how is droidium doing?
[2015-04-23 10:44:28] smikloso: ddary: well
[2015-04-23 10:44:58] smikloso: ddary: i released droidium 1.0 final some time ago and wanted to propagate it but i do not have time for it at all
[2015-04-23 10:45:06] smikloso: ddary: it is kind of sad
[2015-04-23 10:45:27] ddary: droidium is using selendroid, right?
[2015-04-23 10:46:09] smikloso: ddary: yes, for sure, 1.0 release does not support android driver
[2015-04-23 10:46:17] smikloso: ddary: only native instrumentation
[2015-04-23 10:46:43] ddary: and have you heard feedback from the community?
[2015-04-23 10:46:57] ddary: any blogposts?
[2015-04-23 10:56:31] smikloso: ddary: sorry i am at the meeting right now
[2015-04-23 10:56:56] smikloso: ddary: to be honest and have not written any blog post on my own
[2015-04-23 10:57:09] smikloso: ddary: and i have not seen blog posts on the net
[2015-04-23 10:57:26] smikloso: ddary: the thing is that i just need to let people know that it exist
[2015-04-23 10:57:41] smikloso: ddary: you have to shout on the internet in order to be heard
[2015-04-23 10:58:24] ddary: no problem, just wanted to chat a bit, let me know when you have time
[2015-04-23 10:58:56] ddary: i know what you mean with shouting â€¦
[2015-04-23 10:59:42] smikloso: yeah ...
