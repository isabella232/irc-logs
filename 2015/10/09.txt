[2015-10-09 20:10:28] lukeis: asm89: I'd like to note that my pull request shows an example of why it would be very good to move to gradle (or another tool) other than mavenâ€¦ the latest android sdk libs aren't in maven central! there's other projects to locally install them / etcâ€¦ but that's just a hack i don't want to enforce everyone to do.
[2015-10-09 20:11:09] lukeis: simonstewart: buck supports marshmallow, right? :)
[2015-10-09 20:11:18] simonstewart: Buck does
[2015-10-09 20:11:29] lukeis: maven does notâ€¦ sigh...
[2015-10-09 20:11:36] simonstewart: Buck does ;)
[2015-10-09 20:11:56] lukeis: well, not without installing it locally yourself, damn android project not deploying to maven central
