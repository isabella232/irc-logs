[2015-10-16 23:44:07] asm89: lukeis: I can take a stab a buck
[2015-10-16 23:44:09] asm89: lukeis: maybe.
[2015-10-16 23:44:26] asm89: not sure if I care enough, but if I understand correctly maven is just completely broken for us now?
[2015-10-16 23:44:33] lukeis: i though dominik already took a stab
[2015-10-16 23:44:48] lukeis: maven is just not upgradeable
[2015-10-16 23:45:02] lukeis: it's stuck on 4.1.1.4
[2015-10-16 23:45:53] lukeis: there's workaroundsâ€¦ but nothing in maven central, the workarounds disgust me too much to consider it an option :) (and I like maven!)

[2015-10-16 23:46:58] lukeis: so long ago, i'm not sure it'll be worth looking at :)
[2015-10-16 23:47:22] asm89: well simon converted selenium to buck i think?
[2015-10-16 23:47:39] lukeis: noâ€¦ simon is still in the process of converting selenium to buck ;)
[2015-10-16 23:48:02] lukeis: it's mostly there, but we still use the old tool for builds / releases
[2015-10-16 23:48:17] asm89: hm
[2015-10-16 23:48:23] asm89: okay
[2015-10-16 23:48:25] asm89: tricky :)
[2015-10-16 23:48:33] asm89: if we go of maven, where do we put releases?
[2015-10-16 23:48:48] lukeis: gradle would still allow us to make maven releases
[2015-10-16 23:49:06] lukeis: and we could deploy artifacts built with buck into maven
[2015-10-16 23:49:22] asm89: hm ok
[2015-10-16 23:49:33] lukeis: either one is fine in my mind ;)
