[2015-07-20 03:05:01] Basma: I work with selendroid and python tests
[2015-07-20 03:05:13] Basma: but sometimes, the click does not work
[2015-07-20 03:05:48] Basma: or it may take a lot of time to go to the target page
[2015-07-20 03:06:23] Basma: when I increase the sleeping time to wait until the target is reached, selendroid becomes blocked
[2015-07-20 03:06:40] Basma: what should I do?

[2015-07-20 17:48:04] galaxyfreak: ddary, free now?
[2015-07-20 17:49:02] ddary: yes
[2015-07-20 17:51:44] galaxyfreak: could you update xalan and rebuild with jar with dependencies?
[2015-07-20 17:53:47] ddary: let me check
[2015-07-20 17:57:03] ddary: the main question is, what dependency is adding it, because from what i have seen we have not added it.
[2015-07-20 18:00:44] ddary: @asm: I documented what needs to be done during a release. https://github.com/selendroid/selendroid/wiki/Release-It
[2015-07-20 18:01:31] ddary: @asm: in the passt the version  numbers in the androidapplication xml files has been updated automatically. this feature isn missing now and makes releasing harder
