[2015-07-21 19:21:04] renee_: @lukeis: I have a grid setup and for some reason, every time I start my grid, it keeps throwing: Failed to check status of node: server response code:500
[2015-07-21 19:21:29] renee_: my json file config is as follows:
[2015-07-21 19:22:19] renee_: {   "capabilities": [{       "browserName": "android",       "maxInstances": 1,       "androidTarget": "ANDROID17",       "aut": "com.android.twitter:5.61.0-alpha.285"   }, {       "browserName": "android",       "maxInstances": 1,       "androidTarget":"ANDROID18",       "aut": "com.android.twitter:5.61.0-alpha.285"   }],   "configuration": {       "maxSession": 1,       "register": true,       "hubHost": "localhost",       "hubPor
[2015-07-21 19:23:00] renee_: any thoughts on how to resolve it??
[2015-07-21 19:24:49] lukeis: that doesn't appear to be your complete config json? can you :gist it?
[2015-07-21 19:25:34] lukeis: i could only guess that the "host" key in your "configuration" isn't set correctly?
[2015-07-21 19:25:52] lukeis: or maybe the "proxy" isn't set right?
[2015-07-21 19:26:29] lukeis: http://selendroid.io/scale.html  has a good example
[2015-07-21 19:29:03] renee_: https://gist.github.com/niranjani23/5484e22c77a0273d2e52
[2015-07-21 19:30:57] lukeis: and what's your command line(s) to start the grid hub / node?
[2015-07-21 19:41:06] renee_: https://gist.github.com/niranjani23/1e0b55778be2fa9d4b8e
[2015-07-21 19:41:20] renee_: contains both commands to start grid and node
[2015-07-21 19:44:11] renee_: am I missing something?
[2015-07-21 19:44:38] lukeis: doesn't look like it… you have the jars on the classpath where you start the command i asumme...
[2015-07-21 19:45:50] renee_: yes I do
[2015-07-21 19:46:28] lukeis: any reason you're using 0.13 of selendroid rather than the latest?
[2015-07-21 19:47:24] lukeis: oh i read it wrong
[2015-07-21 19:48:08] renee_: no reason...yet to update
[2015-07-21 19:48:15] renee_: do you think updating would help ?
[2015-07-21 19:48:32] lukeis: you have your hub running on 5555
[2015-07-21 19:48:45] lukeis: and your config is suggesting it's the opposite way
[2015-07-21 19:49:32] lukeis: hub in the examples is 4444, the selendroid standalone is 5555
[2015-07-21 19:49:59] lukeis: your command line has the reverse :)
[2015-07-21 19:54:27] renee_: yeh I just updated it
[2015-07-21 19:54:33] renee_: thanks
[2015-07-21 19:55:36] renee_: but it still throws the same error message
[2015-07-21 20:01:02] renee_: any thoughts?
[2015-07-21 20:03:28] lukeis:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯    did you really correct the ports the right way? :)
[2015-07-21 20:08:42] renee_: yup I did
[2015-07-21 20:08:44] renee_: https://gist.github.com/niranjani23/5484e22c77a0273d2e52
[2015-07-21 20:08:52] renee_: I literally copy-pasted my config file info
[2015-07-21 20:35:20] renee_: any thoughts??

[2015-07-21 21:42:58] lukeis: sorry, nope… i don't really know what's going on there, if everything you say is true, it should just be working  (also i don't use grid myself)

[2015-07-21 23:55:30] renee__: hi @lukeis
[2015-07-21 23:55:35] renee__: I got it working
[2015-07-21 23:55:46] renee__: but when I do a hub/status
[2015-07-21 23:56:07] renee__: {"status":13,"value":{"message":"Session [(null externalkey)] not available and is not among the last 1000 terminated sessions.\nActive sessions are[]","class":"org.openqa.grid.common.exception.GridException","stackTrace":[{"fileName":"ActiveTestSessions.java","className":"org.openqa.grid.internal.ActiveTestSessions","methodName":"getExistingSession","lineNumber":110},{"fileName":"Registry.java","className":"org.openqa.grid.interna
[2015-07-21 23:56:14] renee__: I see the above error message
[2015-07-21 23:56:31] renee__: Is there a way to reset everything ?
[2015-07-21 23:56:41] renee__: seems like it remembers the old sessions
